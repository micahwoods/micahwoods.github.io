The 2006 to 2016 era ATC website always had a library or turf info page where I made a number of articles and reference documents available for download. With this current website, I didn't have something quite like that, so today I made one.

[You can find it here](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/library/), with more than 40 articles, ranging from the arcane and detailed to the interesting and practical, with pretty much everything in between.
