Jack Fry has written about MLSN in his [**what's the big idea?**](https://lscpagepro.mydigitalpublication.com/publication/?i=620112&ver=html5&p=68) column. You can find this in the October 2019 issue of *Golf Course Management* magazine.

> "The MLSN model fits well into the low-input strategy that many golf course superintendents have developed to help maintenance costs fit the operating budget. For some, this approach means reducing nitrogen and water applications. Maintaining turf quality, but reducing growth, can result in other savings, including labor for mowing, and equipment operation and maintenance.
