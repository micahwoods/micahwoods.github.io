The Michigan GCSA's Spring issue of ["Course Conditions"](https://issuu.com/migcsa/docs/_42___course_conditions___spring_20/6) is now out, and it includes a 5 page feature article that I called [*Measuring clipping volume is easier and more useful than I expected*.](http://www.files.asianturfgrass.com/201906_woods_migcsa_clipvol.pdf)

In the article, I explained "how clipping volume works and what it is all about." The article includes explanations of:

* how and when I became interested in this topic
* the units of measure 
* machine consistency and green to green consistency
* clipping volume and playability
* clipping volume and turfgrass performance
* nutrient use and optimum nutrient supply
* resource use and a return to playability
