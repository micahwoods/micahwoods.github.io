I had an open discussion today with a group of greenkeepers in Japan. We talked about a lot of things -- bentgrass in summer, irrigation, fertilizer, organic matter management, roots, etc. Here are three links to more information:

* [夏の散水管理：タイミング,水量,シリンジング,および水質](http://www.files.asianturfgrass.com/201306_summer_irrigation_jp.pdf)
* [ET（蒸発散値: 標準 ETと特定作物 ET）計算機](https://asianturfgrass.shinyapps.io/et_calc_jp/)
* [日本語のATCアップデートのメーリングリストに参加を申し込む](http://www.subscribepage.com/atcupdate_jp)

For English versions of those same documents, apps, and links, see:

* [Irrigation Management in Summer: timing, amount, syringing, and water quality](http://www.files.asianturfgrass.com/201306_summer_irrigation.pdf)
* [Evapotranspiration (ET) calculator](https://asianturfgrass.shinyapps.io/ET_calculator/)
