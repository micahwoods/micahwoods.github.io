I moved my books to a different room in my home office earlier this month.

One of those books contains this strongly-worded sentence. 

![quote on the misuse of fertiliser for golfing surfaces](/img/fertiliser_quote1.png)

These "disasters,"expensive corrective measures," and "deterioration of good golfing conditions" are completely avoidable. If you'd like to read about people and techniques being used to avoid these problems, here's an eclectic list to get started: 

* My book [*A Short Grammar of Greenkeeping*](https://leanpub.com/short_grammar_of_greenkeeping) gives an overview.

* James Sergeant described the results he is getting with these techniques. In short, ["Members very happy visitors envious!"](https://twitter.com/lonegreenkeeper/status/1010253951231512577)

* Jason Haines wonders if [feast or famine](http://www.turfhacker.com/2018/06/is-feast-or-famine-beneficial.html) nutrient applications may be better than light and frequent.
* Just yesterday, Andrew McDaniel [showed surfaces (and roots)](https://twitter.com/drumcturf/status/1010330051689107456) produced without application of fertilizer P, Ca, or carbon---except the C in urea---for the past five years.
