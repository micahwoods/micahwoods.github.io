There were [these top 10](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2019-12-26-top-blog-posts-2019/) that *everyone* read. 

And then there were these bottom 10 that almost *no one* read. Just in case you missed any of these the first time around, I'm giving them another chance here.

[1] April, [The ATC Turfgrass Library](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2019-04-09-atc-turfgrass-library/)

[2] September, [Grass on the Kumamoto City Tram lines](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2019-09-07-kumamoto-city-tram-grass/) with a look at the beautiful grass in the heart of the city, and some videos of the *amazing* mowing system used to cut this grass.

[3] June, [Turf color, consistency, and the oldest course in Thailand](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2019-06-05-turf-consistency-color/). I really thought this one would get more views. It has pretty pictures, a birdie dance, and elephants in a winery. In re-reading the post just now, I see that I showed colors and didn't discuss the *consistency* that I included in the title. The idea is, consistency of good playing conditions is a desirable goal, and consistency of color through the year is not necessarily required.

[4, tie] July, [The Cornell Turf Talk Podcast with Special Guest David Hicks](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2019-07-10-cornell-turf-talk-with-david-hicks/) was really good, and I recommend it.

[4, tie] September, [New ATC Media Library with videos, podcasts, and more](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2019-09-28-videos-podcasts-more-media-library/)

[6] March, [Tokyo temperatures and growth potential, animated](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2019-03-10-tokyo-temperature-gp-animated/). This has interesting charts.

[7] March, ["Pretty hopeless in predicting deficiency"](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2019-03-05-hopeless-in-predicting-deficiency/) is a quote about tissue tests for micronutrients.

[8] November, [Grammatik for greenkeepere, plus buckets and stimp stats](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2019-11-12-grammatik-for-greenkeepere/)

[9, tie] January, [Ten posts that no one read in 2018](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2019-01-27-ten-posts-no-one-read-2018/) 

[9, tie] December, [The top 10 posts of 2019](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2019-12-26-top-blog-posts-2019/)
