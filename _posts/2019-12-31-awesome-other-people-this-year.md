Here's a non-comprehensive list for this year. I've certainly missed lots of awesome things. If you'd like to add them, please do so in the comments.

* Ross Braun and Dale Bremer wrote [a fascinating article](https://dx.doi.org/10.2134/age2018.12.0060) about carbon sequestration of zoysiagrass turf.

* Maggie Reiter showed [this striking aerial image](https://twitter.com/maggie_reiter/status/1199730314009907200?s=20) of herbicide effect over time.

Figure shows example images of herbicide efficacy over time <a href="https://t.co/MVwNCUNeGC">pic.twitter.com/MVwNCUNeGC</a></p>&mdash; Maggie Reiter (@maggie_reiter) <a href="https://twitter.com/maggie_reiter/status/1199730314009907200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 27, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

* John Dempsey has shared a lot of his slides from [presentations all over the world this year](https://www.slideshare.net/JohnDempsey8). Thank you! 

* Miranda Robinson shared awesome photos, videos, insight, and humour all year. If I had a vote, [this would be tweet of the year](https://twitter.com/turfmow/status/1140961675773956096?s=20).

* Bruce Clarke, Paul Vincelli, Paul Koch, and Gregg Munshaw updated the [Chemical Control of Turfgrass Diseases 2020](https://twitter.com/turfmow/status/1140961675773956096?s=20) reference. There's an amazing amount of useful information in those 34 pages.

* It's awesome when there is a golf event happening and the [GCSAA's tournament fact sheet](https://www.gcsaa.org/media/tournament-fact-sheets) is available with background information about the course maintenance.

* It's awesome to have programs and events like [Syngenta's Growing Golf](https://www.growinggolf.com/), [Bayer's Women in Golf](https://www.environmentalscience.bayer.us/turf-and-ornamentals-management/golf-course-management/women-in-golf), the GCSAA's Ladies Leading Turf event at the [Golf Industry Show](https://www.golfindustryshow.com/events/gcsaa-wednesday-events), to encourage and support women in the turf industry.

* Some of the top courses in the Philippines have women superintendents and/or assistant superintendents and staff. It's awesome to see that and to see the support for the industry there by [Nutranta Inc.](https://www.facebook.com/nutrantainc/photos/a.746817742334999/1020478098302294/?type=3&theater)

* The new [*Turfgrass Management*](https://turfpath.com/book) book by Turgeon and Kaminski sets the standard for quality and value. It's full colour, which is a rarity in turf books, and also about half the price of comparable titles. 

* Fredrik Seeger translated the [MLSN Cheat Sheet](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2018-02-03-new-mlsn-cheat-sheet/) into a [2 page Swedish language version](http://www.files.asianturfgrass.com/mlsn_cheat_sheet_se.pdf). How awesome is that?

* Paige Boyle and co-authors wrote a review on a topic of worldwide interest: [Ecology and management of earthworm casting on sports turf.](https://doi.org/10.1002/ps.5479) 

* There's been a lot of discussion over the past few years about mental health in the industry and taking care of ourselves and others. It was awesome to see Dave Wilber and others in the industry featured in the [Silent Struggles](https://reader.golfdigest.com/2019/09/03/silent-struggles-taboos-tattoossuperintendents-are-taking-steps-to-save-colleagues-who-contemplate-suicide/content.html) article in *Golf Digest*.

* Frank Rossi with his [Frankly Speaking podcast](https://www.turfnet.com/podcasts/rossi/), and all his guests this year, brought a lot of information to thousands of people who enjoyed listening to those episodes.

* Also Joe Gulotti with [The Talking Greenkeeper](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-talking-greenkeeper/id1435947281), brought information and laughs to a lot of people. The show has a 4.9 rating on Apple Podcasts. That's awesome.

* The USGA [*Green Section Record*](https://www.usga.org/course-care/green-section-record.html) had another year with lots of must-read articles. A couple of my favorites were Brian Whitlark and Cole Thompson on [topdressing](http://gsrpdf.lib.msu.edu/ticpdf.py?file=/article/whitlark-thompson-light-5-3-19.pdf) and Chris Hartwiger on [measuring putting green performance](http://gsrpdf.lib.msu.edu/ticpdf.py?file=/article/whitlark-thompson-light-5-3-19.pdf). 

* 

This idea is based on [Jeff Leek's non-comprehensive awesome lists](https://simplystatistics.org/2017/12/20/a-non-comprehensive-list-of-awesome-things-other-people-did-in-2017/) from [Simply Statistics](https://simplystatistics.org/).
