I'd read the soil sampling instructions from Penn State and Rutgers, suggesting a minimum of 12 subsamples be combined as a composite sample for each area. When I give instructions for sampling, I suggest a minimum of 5 subsamples be collected per green (or per area). And the [Donohue article I've written about](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2020-02-04-composite-samples-3/) suggests 20 samples be collected from an area about the size of 4 typical putting greens.

<small><strong>The standard recommendation for turfgrass seems to be a minimum of 12 samples for an area the size of a golf course putting green.</strong></small>

I wondered what other people do, so I sent out [this poll on Twitter](https://twitter.com/asianturfgrass/status/1220536864701992961), asking "When collecting samples for soil nutrient analysis on golf course putting greens, how many subsamples do you collect to make a single composite sample for one putting green?"

The results, excluding those who answered the survey just to see results, came to a total of 182 respondents.

<small><strong>Percent of poll respondents collecting this number of subsamples per green to make a composite sample.</strong></small>

| Subsamples | Percent |
|---|---|
| 1 to 5  | 12%  |
| 6 to 10  | 45%  |
| 11 or more  | 43%  |

It seems a lot of turfgrass managers are following the standard recommendations of at least 12 subsamples per area. And I was surprised there were so few respondents collecting 5 or less subsamples.
