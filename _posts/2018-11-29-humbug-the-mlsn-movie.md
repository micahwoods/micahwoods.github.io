[This is a movie](https://vimeo.com/micahwoods/humbug) about making fertilizer recommendations from soil tests using MLSN.

I hope you enjoy watching this, and that this video provides a few new bits of information about what MLSN is and how it works.

I'd like to thank Niels Dokkuma from the Netherlands Golf Federation for inviting me to submit a video on this topic (more background on the [story behind this video here](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2018-11-17-new-mlsn-movie-trailer/). Thank you also to Larry Stowell, Sue Crawford, Bjarni Hannesson, and Andrew McDaniel for taking my calls and agreeing to appear in this movie. Additional thanks are due to Bjarni who worked as the audio engineer on this project.
