Playability is what it is all about, isn't it? At least for putting greens, one wants to have surfaces upon which the ball rolls at a certain pace, and which have a firmness that is appropriate for the conditions.

On 10 December, I'm giving a presentation for AGIF about this very topic. You can read the [announcement, and find the registration link, here](https://agif.asia/2020/11/micah-woods-secrets-to-producing-great-putting-surfaces/).

It starts with choosing the type of playing conditions one wants to have. Then measuring those conditions. I will explain the key measurements to make, and how to adjust soil and grass conditions to produce the playing surfaces one wants to have. It's pretty simple, and every golf facility has the ability to do this, and to implement the method I'll describe to have surfaces that meet the desired standard in the most efficient manner possible.
