I'm taking this idea from Jeff Leek at the [Simply Statistics](https://simplystatistics.org/2017/12/20/a-non-comprehensive-list-of-awesome-things-other-people-did-in-2017/) blog. He's been putting together a list of awesome things other people did each year. He makes the list off the top of his head. My memory is not that good, so I've referred to some notes in addition to the top of my head. I'm sure I've missed lots of awesome things. If you'd like to add them, please do so in the comments.

* The [Greenkeeper](http://greenkeeperapp.com/marketing/) app by Bill Kreuser keeps getting better.
* Kreuser also wrote about PGR over-regulation on [putting green collars](https://turf.unl.edu/turfinfo/5_4_PGR_Collars.pdf) and about the nuance of [GDD calculations](https://turf.unl.edu/turfinfo/9-28_GDD_Calcs.pdf).
* Beth Guertal was voted president-elect of the [Crop Science Society of America](http://ocm.auburn.edu/newsroom/news_articles/2017/05/guertal-president-elect-of-crop-science-society-of-america.htm).

* Joe Gulotti started [a blog](http://www.thewalkinggreenkeeper.com/), The Walking Greenkeeper. You won't find anything like it. The first post, as an introduction, was titled ["I was a total sellout"](http://www.thewalkinggreenkeeper.com/2017/03/i-was-total-sellout.html). And he spoke at the Penn State Golf Turf Conference.
