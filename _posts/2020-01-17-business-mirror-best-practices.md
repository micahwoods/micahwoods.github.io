A friend sent me a link to the [Business Mirror's Golf Section](https://issuu.com/businessmirror/docs/businessmirror_november_30__2019/5) and said I should check it out. I just did that, and found a report on Nutranta's Best Practices seminar on page 5.

I spoke about a continuous improvement system for turfgrass, and recorded [this screencast](https://vimeo.com/375475148) describing my presentation.
