James Faust and Joanne Logan wrote a review of daily light integral (DLI) in the [September issue of *HortScience*](https://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTSCI13144-18).

They have also prepared [high resolution maps of the United States](https://arcg.is/X4G4K). If you click on a location on the map, a table and chart will display with the average annual and monthly DLI.
