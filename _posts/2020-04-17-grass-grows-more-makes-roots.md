When I saw how these grasses were growing at [#ATC南店](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ATC%E5%8D%97%E5%BA%97?src=hashtag_click), I jotted down a couple notes for a future blog post---this one. 

* *when grass grows more, it makes more roots*

* *the amount of aboveground material makes more photosynthesis makes more roots*

I grew planted grass as 3 cm diameter plugs, planted in pots filled with coconut coir on 1 October 2019, and then fertilized the pots with different materials. After 100 days, the zoysia fertilized with N and P and K had almost completely covered the pot surface area. The pot of zoysia that got only N had not.

The grass fertilized with P and K in amounts matching the plant requirements was growing more. Naturally, this grass created a **larger** plant---more aboveground and belowground biomass within the same size pot.

When there is more photosynthesis, one can expect the grass to create a more extensive root system.

These pots are no more. I sliced them open last week, took a couple more photos, then planted them at another location. Looking at the cross-section shows another view of how much more aboveground growth there was in the pot fertilized with enough nutrients, compared with the grass deficient in P and K.

As I pointed out in [a previous post](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2020-04-03-roots-p-k-deficient-grass/), the N-only pot is deficient in P and K. The pot fertilized with P and K in an amount proportional to grass demand grew a lot bigger, because that grass is supplied with all the P and K that the grass can use.

This illustrates how the MLSN guidelines ensure grass is supplied with enough nutrients. In this case, I didn't know the soil nutrient levels at the time of planting. But I could assume they are negligible. In such a case, where soil nutrient levels are low, MLSN recommendations for nutrients simplify to 100% of plant use.
