This isn't just a story about the fertilizer choices or the costs. There is a lot more to it, and I encourage you to read the entire post at Gulotti's [The Walking Greenkeeper](http://www.thewalkinggreenkeeper.com/2018/01/near-end-of-summer-last-season-john.html) blog.

This is a quote, with all emphases mine.

Of course one gets excellent grass conditions by supplying the grass with all the nutrients it can use, while still keeping a safe buffer in reserve. That's what MLSN is all about, so that's no surprise. And one can save a lot of money too, if one wants to, without any reduction in turf quality. That's good to know. 

But what I really enjoy to read about is the fun this brings to the work. Reinvigorating, improving one's mettle, feeling like an environmental steward. That's awesome.
