Filming is complete for episode 3 of ATC's *Grammar of Greenkeeping* show and [the trailer](https://vimeo.com/490095020) came out today.

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/490095020" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

This film [had been scheduled](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2020-11-16-truth-about-great-turf-seminar/) to debut at an AGIF webinar this month. Some of the member companies apparently didn't want this information from ATC to come out through the AGIF, so it is coming to you straight from ATC.

I think this might be the best one yet. I hope you'll enjoy the full episode later this month. For now, enjoy [the trailer](https://vimeo.com/490095020).
