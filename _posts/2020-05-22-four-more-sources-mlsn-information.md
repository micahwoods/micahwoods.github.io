In my recent "How MLSN Works" seminar---[slides here](https://speakerdeck.com/micahwoods/how-mlsn-works)---I mentioned some other ways to learn more about MLSN. The four items I recommended are:

* The [Humbug movie](https://vimeo.com/micahwoods/humbug) which explains MLSN and includes discussions with turfgrass managers who have used it.

* The [MLSN cheat sheet](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2018-02-03-new-mlsn-cheat-sheet/), 2 information-packed pages with all the details of this topic, answers to common questions, and more.

* From the TurfNet webinar archives, my presentation about [MLSN Guidelines: what they are and how to use them](https://www.turfnet.com/webinar_archives.html/mlsn-guidelines-what-they-are-and-how-to-use-them-r117/). This was a 10 minute presentation with 50 minutes devoted to questions and answers.

* I recorded a screencast of my presentation at the European Turfgrass Society conference in 2018, [Turfgrass fertiliser recommendations with or without soil tests](https://vimeo.com/micahwoods/ets18). This explains how the MLSN guidelines can be used to make effective nutrient recommendations for turfgrass all around the world.
