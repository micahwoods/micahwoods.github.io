I'll be teaching a webinar on Friday, May 22, at 10 a.m. New York time, about **How MLSN Works**. The webinar is for the [Amplify](https://www.amplifytogether.com/) network and is free and open to everyone. 

Contact Chris Eidson (ceidson [at] blinc [dot] com), the Education Specialist at Brookside Labs, to register.

I put the title slide together, and that's it for the slides so far. I have made some notes about what I'd like to discuss:

Objective
: What we are trying to do with fertilizer
: Finding the optimum fertilizer amount, this extends to NOT too much, also NOT too little

Development
: A new visualization of how the guidelines are developed, based on something I thought of (and wished I had shown then) during my [MLSN seminar series in Sweden](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2019-11-30-3-hours-mlsn-one-slide/)

Procedure
: Soil test, pick time duration, compare to grass use

Simulation
: Use a set of soil test results and show the fertilizer recommendations using MLSN 

Something like that.
