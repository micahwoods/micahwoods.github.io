After I read the article by Lawrence et al. on [Guiding soil sampling strategies using classical and spatial
statistics: A review](https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/agj2.20048), I made some calculations, sent a few email inquiries, looked up some standard recommendations for turfgrass testing, reread another article on this topic, sent out a Twitter poll, and started drafting a blog post.

I soon realized that it might be a long blog post. Too long, probably. And the topic of soil sampling and the number of cores (or subsamples) to collect to then put together as a single composite sample representative of the tested area---that's a particularly dry subject, isn't it? So I decided to break that post I'd drafted into a number of short ones.

![multiple cores taken for soil sampling on a single green](/img/grid_samples.jpg)
<small><strong>How many cores should be taken from a single putting green, or sports field, or fairway, or lawn, to put together as a composite sample for soil nutrient analysis?</strong></small>

In these posts, I'll be considering soil nutrient analyses. I'll often use individual putting greens as an example. 

A standard recommendation seems to be what I found in the [Soil Sampling Instructions for Turfgrass](https://njaes.rutgers.edu/soil-testing-lab/pdfs/sport/Golf_and_Sports_Turfgrass_-_Soil_Sampling_Instructions.pdf) from Rutgers.

For testing of a single putting green, they recommend a composite sample be made up of 12 to 15 subsamples.

The instructions read, 

> "Plan to collect multiple subsamples randomly within each defined area to obtain a representative sample. For a uniform sports field or fairway, 20 to 30 subsample locations may be needed, whereas 12 to 15 subsamples may be adequate on a golf green or tee ... placing the soil subsamples in a clean plastic bucket to obtain a composite sample."
