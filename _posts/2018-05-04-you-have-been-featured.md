The India Golf Expo was held in Bangalore last month, and I was there to speak at the R&A seminar on sustainable golf course renovation and maintenance in India.

You can read about the Expo and the R&A seminar, along with plenty of photos from the [*Golf Digest India*](http://indiagolfdigest.com/golf-digest-india-may-2018/) reporting from this event. That starts on page 14, and on page 21 see a portion of what I wrote for the 32 page seminar booklet that was distributed to all delegates.
