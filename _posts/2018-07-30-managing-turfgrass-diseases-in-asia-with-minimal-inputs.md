These are [my slides](https://speakerdeck.com/micahwoods/managing-turfgrass-diseases-in-asia-with-minimal-input-1) for today's presentation in the "Precision Turf and Ornamental Disease Management in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century" session at the International Congress of Plant Pathology in Boston.

The [abstract for my presentation is here](https://apsnet.confex.com/apsnet/ICPP2018/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/3992). I'm not a plant pathologist, but what I'm talking about---and what I work on---is very much related to the theme of this year's Congress: *plant health in a global economy*.
