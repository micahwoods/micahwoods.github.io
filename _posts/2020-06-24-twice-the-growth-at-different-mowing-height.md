Bill Kreuser shared a [fascinating update](https://twitter.com/UNLturf/status/1273627290191069185?s=20) from one of the experiments he is conducting this summer.

[![img of tweet by Bill Kreuser about 2x growth rate](/img/kreuser_2x_growth.jpg)](https://twitter.com/UNLturf/status/1273627290191069185?s=20)

I wouldn't have expected to see such a big difference in growth rate with a mowing height difference of 0.04 inches (1 mm). 

The implications of this include double the nutrient use at the lower height of cut. It makes a lot of sense to measure how much the grass is growing so that this can be known, rather than guessed at. The easiest way I've found to do that is to measure the volume of fresh clippings when the grass is mown.
