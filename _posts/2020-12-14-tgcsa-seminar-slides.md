Today I gave a seminar at the Thai GCSA meeting.

We talked about a number of topics. One thing I tried to emphasize was that playing conditions will be best when the grass is growing the slowest. I also reminded the audience that if grass doesn't grow for long enough, the grass will die. So it can be risky to grow the grass slowly, and measuring the growth rate by the rapid clipping volume ([#ClipVol](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/tags/#clipvol)) assessment can be a really useful tool. Here are some blog posts related to today's presentation and discussion topics:
