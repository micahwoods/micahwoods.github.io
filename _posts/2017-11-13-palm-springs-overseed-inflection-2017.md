Last week [I wrote about some calculations](http://www.asianturfgrass.com/2017-11-05-overseeding-inflection/) to find the inflection point when the temperatures change from being better for warm-season grass (like bermudagrass, seashore paspalum, or zoysia) to being better for cool-season grasses (like perennial ryegrass, creeping bentgrass, or kentucky bluegrass). This inflection point can be represented on a chart as the minimum value for the cumulative sum of the warm-season growth potential (C<sub>4</sub>GP) subtracted from the cool-season growth potential (C<sub>3</sub>GP). Over a long time series, the median date for this inflection point in Palm Springs, California, is October 13.

At the time I made the calculations in late October, Palm Springs hadn't reached the inflection point yet. I was curious when it happened, so I downloaded the most recent data today. It seems the inflection point this year, using data from the airport, happened on October 29.
