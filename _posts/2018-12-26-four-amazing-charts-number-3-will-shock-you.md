I've written [before](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2017-09-01-gp-explained-photos/) about the environmental productivity index (EPI), the growth potential, and [nutrients](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/tags/#fertilizer). Park Nobel's EPI "incorporates simultaneous effects of water, temperature, PAR [photosynthetically active radiation], and even nutrients" to predict the productivity, or the rate of generation of biomass.

Turfgrass managers can modify the plant water status with drainage and irrigation. Turfgrass managers can modify the nutrient supply with fertilizer---I recommend using [MLSN](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/tags/#mlsn) for that. But turfgrass managers can't do much to modify the temperature or the PAR. That's where the effect of climate comes into turfgrass management and turfgrass species selection.
