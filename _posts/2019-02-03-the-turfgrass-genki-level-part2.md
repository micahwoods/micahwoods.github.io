I showed in [part 1](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2019-02-03-the-turfgrass-genki-level-part1/) how one can go from temperature to a temperature-based growth potential to a *standard* N amount.

By looking at the actual N applied, and comparing that amount to the standard N for any location, one gets what I call the **genki level**. 

If less N is applied than the standard amount, the GL will be less than 1. If more N is applied than the standard amount, the GL will be more than 1. The GL provides an indication of:

* how much the grass is being pushed to grow
* how much one is withholding N at a time when the grass has a high potential to use N
* how that pushing and withholding varies through the year, or from site to site

Let's look in a little more detail at the GL development at Van Tri GC in Hanoi.

Van Tri is wall-to-wall seashore paspalum. One can start with the temperatures, then work through to the GL as shown in this chart. During the winter months, more N is applied to maintain colour and to try to minimize dollar spot damage.

What about during the summer months? Why is there sometimes a high GL then too, and an annual GL of 1.3? Much of this comes down to management style and grass conditions at the time. And I think there is a relation to grass species too, in this case. Seashore paspalum gets overrun in this climate by *Cynodon* and sometimes even *Zoysia*. In order to minimize problems with those invading species, and to minimize problems with weeds in general, seashore paspalum is often maintained at a relatively rapid growth rate.
