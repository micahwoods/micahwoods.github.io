Those are the results Jason Haines described in his post about [the evolution of precision fertilizer application](http://www.turfhacker.com/2017/11/the-evolution-of-precision-fertilizer.html). He explains how he makes use of observations, measurements, and predictions to find site specific nutrient requirements.

It's a good read, and it has this animated chart that shows how N rates have decreased over the past few years.
