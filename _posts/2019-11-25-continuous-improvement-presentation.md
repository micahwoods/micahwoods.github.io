I've recorded a quick video to describe the presentation I delivered at Nutranta's Best Practices seminar last week.

I spoke about a [continuous improvement system for turfgrass](https://vimeo.com/micahwoods/improve).

In the presentation, I mentioned the article [A Year of Measuring Putting Green Performance](http://gsrpdf.lib.msu.edu/ticpdf.py?file=/article/hartwiger-year-11-1-19.pdf) by Chris Hartwiger.

In the video I put together today I rushed through these topics. During the seminar I spoke for a more leisurely 45 minutes about these same things, and then [Andrew McDaniel](https://twitter.com/asianturfgrass/status/1198772920258113537?s=20), the greenkeeper and assistant general manager of Keya GC in Japan, spoke about his work.

It was really good, and he shared handout templates that he uses for daily &amp; annual planning. <a href="https://t.co/K6hZ8uWOy6">https://t.co/K6hZ8uWOy6</a> <a href="https://t.co/rLBkSW4Ade">pic.twitter.com/rLBkSW4Ade</a></p>&mdash; Micah Woods (@asianturfgrass) <a href="https://twitter.com/asianturfgrass/status/1198772920258113537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 25, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
