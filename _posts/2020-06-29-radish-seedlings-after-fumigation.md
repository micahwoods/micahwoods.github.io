Last November I saw a creeping bentgrass nursery in Japan. The nusery had been fumigated to kill seeds in the soil before the bentgrass seeds were planted.

I was surprised to see, scattered across the nursery, plants with big leaves that clearly were *not* creeping bentgrass.

"What's that?" I asked, wondering how such plants could be growing if the soil had been fumigated?

"It's a *daikon*," the greenkeeper told me. That's a big radish, [*Raphanus sativus* var. longipinnatus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daikon).

"These *daikon* seeds germinate in just a few days," he told me.  "We use them to check that the soil is safe for planting the bentgrass, after fumigation."

I hadn't seen that before. That's a cool turfhack and no need to worry about those radishes infesting the bentgrass nursery as a weed. The radishes won't tolerate low mowing, so once the bentgrass is mown, no more *daikon*.
