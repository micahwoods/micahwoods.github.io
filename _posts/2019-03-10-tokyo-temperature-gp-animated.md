I made a note a couple months ago to make animated charts showing the cool-season (C<sub>3</sub>) and warm-season (C<sub>4</sub>) turfgrass growth potential over a 100+ year period for Tokyo. I was interested to see what those charts would look like. Here's my note:

```
Animate 100 years of GP curves with shadow
do an animation in Japan of GP through the years and see if leaving shadows show something like a shift that implies getting better for C3 or better for C4
```

First I got the average monthly temperatures from Tokyo since 1875.

Then I calculated the [temperature-based growth potential (GP)]()
