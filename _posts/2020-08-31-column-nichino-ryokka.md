There's a new column on the Nichino Ryokka website. It's a collaboration between ATC and Nichino Ryokka, with some selected content from the ATC site published in Japanese. The [first column is here](http://www.nichino-ryokka.co.jp/column/1513/), and the topic is a 12 point checklist for dealing with creeping bentgrass heat stress (the [original list is here](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2018-09-23-catching-up-on-reading-heat-stress/)).

In addition to the translated content, there will be a few newly commisioned articles on interesting topics. This heat stress checklist is a timely one.

I've checked the data from this year and again looked at the average air temperature at Kumagaya in Saitama; at Blackville in South Carolina; and at Avondale in Pennsylvania.

Those temperatures will put some heat stress on creeping bentgrass. I'd consider the heat stress to be especially intense when the average temperature is above 25 Â°C.
