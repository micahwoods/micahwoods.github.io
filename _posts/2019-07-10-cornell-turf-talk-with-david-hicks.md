I worked for David Hicks when I was a graduate student at Cornell University, and I worked with him on some soil testing and tissue testing projects too. We didn't give a thought to clipping volume back then. 

A few months ago, Hicks sat down with Carl Schimenti to [discuss clipping volume measurements](https://twitter.com/Cornell_Turf/status/1105075497271205888) made in 2018 at the Robert Trent Jones Golf Course.

We twisted his arm to collect clippings last year, and sat down with him to discuss the experiment.

It was a pleasure to hear Dave's experience and thoughts about this process. You [can listen to the conversation here](http://www.hort.cornell.edu/turf/podcast/turf-talk20190310.mp3).
