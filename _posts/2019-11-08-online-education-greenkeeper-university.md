Most of you will be familiar with the [GreenKeeper App](https://www.greenkeeperapp.com/marketing/). It is a decision support tool for turfgrass professionals that includes pest outbreak models, product (and growing degree day) tracking, weather reporting and much more.

An exciting new offering from the GreenKeeper App developers is a suite of online educational programs about turfgrass science. From nutrient and soil management to disease, weather, and turf stress, these [GreenKeeper University](https://university.greenkeeperapp.com/) courses look really interesting.
