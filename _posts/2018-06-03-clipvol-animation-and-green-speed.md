This week I've thought of a couple things about [#ClipVol](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ClipVol?src=hash).

### Clipping volume data on a calendar timeline

I've shared a lot of charts about clipping volume, and as this growing season gets underway in the northern hemisphere, I thought of how I really think of this, and wondered if I could describe it on an animated chart. I wrote about this to a correspondent:

> "I think what I really would like to see, or what I am imagining, is showing the raw data (all the greens) like a shadow in the background, and then have a 5 or 7 day average moving through that, as a line that is smoother but it is either trending up, or trending down."

I continued to think about that and then made an annotated animated chart to describe it.

### Clipping volume and green speed

I've been most interested in clipping volume as a way to measure how much the grass is growing and how many nutrients the grass is using. Because of that, I want to know the total quantity of clippings removed, and I have reported the data in that way. I know a lot of people like to look at the relationship between clipping volume and green speed too. If one expresses the clipping volume as volume/area/mow, rather than volume/area/day, this relationship may be a little more obvious.

In that way, with a double cut, the volume is reduced by 50%, and of course one expects the speed with a double cut to go up.
