Yesterday I spoke with a group of turfgrass managers in the Philippines at the Nutranta Turf Science in Action seminar.

![seminar room](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/img/nutranta_room.jpg)

I talked about plant growth regulator (PGR) use in a tropical environment and what to expect when using PGRs---especially trinexapac-ethyl---in the Philippines.

[These are my slides](https://speakerdeck.com/micahwoods/what-to-expect-from-plant-growth-regulators) for that presentation.

I also spoke about putting surface performance and how a measurement of *all* the organic matter at the surface can be used to adjust and optimize the maintenance work. [Those slides](https://speakerdeck.com/micahwoods/peak-performance-from-putting-greens-and-the-role-of-organic-matter) are here.

I expect to have videos of these presentations and will share those when they are available.
