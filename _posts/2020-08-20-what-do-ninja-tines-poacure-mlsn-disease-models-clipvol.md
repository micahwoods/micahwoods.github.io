What's the common theme? You'll hear all these topics discussed in recent episodes of Frank Rossi's  [Frankly Speaking](https://www.turfnet.com/podcasts/rossi/) show on TurfNet, or in his [presentation for the ASTMA](https://youtu.be/iMtn6_Uxm3o)

My usual schedule is such that I don't listen to podcasts on a regular basis. A couple of quirks in my schedule recently gave some time to do a marathon listen (or binge listen?) to a bunch of recent Frankly Speaking podcasts. And I was so impressed at the range of content, and all the new ideas discussed in them, that I was going to write a blog post recommending a listen if you can. And then last night I saw the ASTMA presentation was available, and I watched that with the convenient 1.5x speed setting on YouTube.

Real quick, some of the things you'll hear discussed include:

* if there are good reasons to core aerify sand-based greens

* golf spikes and rolling and ball roll and traffic and mowing height interactions

* [MLSN](https://www.paceturf.org/index.php/journal/minimum_level_for_sustainable_nutrition) and whether you might need more

* the utility of [ClipVol](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/buckets/) 

* PoaCure and use examples

* how much does a ball deviate from the intended line when it strikes a *Poa annua* plant in a bentgrass green?

* Does the Smith-Kerns dollar spot model work well?

* What does he think about Ninja tines?

* grass varieties and disease susceptibility and what happens when more resistant varieties are used

* data in turfgrass management today---is it overdone?

I've left out a ton; I've forgotten a ton. But I was impressed at how much useful content Dr. Rossi has been producing over the past couple of months, and I'm fascinated at how many new topics he is able to introduce and discuss. I think you'll be similarly impressed.
