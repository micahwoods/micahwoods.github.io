Last week I led a seminar about MLSN on Monday. Then I did it again on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. In these approximately three hour seminars each day, I went into a lot of detail about [MLSN](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2018-02-03-new-mlsn-cheat-sheet/). 

I explained the results one gets with MLSN, what prompted us to develop these new guidelines, and how to make practical use of the guidelines. I'm not going to record a video or a screencast of everything I talked about for those three hours. But I summarized the key points in this one slide:
