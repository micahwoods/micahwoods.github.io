With so many delegates to [BTME](http://btme.org.uk/)---the BIGGA Turf Management Exhibition---using Twitter to communicate about the event, I thought it would be interesting to look at some statistics related to the [#BTME2019](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BTME2019?src=hash) hashtag. 

I first saw this type of conference analysis done by Neil Saunders, and I have largely used [his code](https://github.com/neilfws/Twitter) to do this analysis.

Please note that I looked just at tweets sent (London time) from January 18 to January 26 that included the  [#BTME2019](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BTME2019?src=hash) hashtag. I know some people were tweeting with #BTME19 or #BTME or mentioning @BIGGA_BTME or @BIGGALtd or were tweeting about BTME without any tags at all. This analysis doesn't look at those.

There were 1,202 tweets (including retweets) with that "official" [#BTME2019](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BTME2019?src=hash) hashtag on those dates.

During the Continue to Learn days and then at BTME itself, these were the number of tweets per hour.

![btme per hour](/img/btme_per_hour.png)

Of those accounts using the #BTME2019 hashtag, these are the top tweeters, those sending 5 or more tweets with that tag from January 18 to 26.

There were some conversations about #BTME2019 too. This network graph shows the accounts that were replying to each other about #BTME2019.

Lots of people were tweeting from iPhones.

What were people tweeting about? I looked at all the words used in the 1,202 tweets, excluding some common [stop words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words) and excluding BTME and excluding Harrogate.

Here's a word cloud of the words that remained.
