There's a [new spreadsheet](https://www.paceturf.org/PTRI/Documents/Sand_GP_1.xls) available from [PACE Turf](https://www.paceturf.org/) that uses the temperature-based [growth potential](https://www.paceturf.org/reference/Turf_growth_potential) to estimate the quantity of sand required as topdressing. They [wrote](https://www.paceturf.org/memberedition/sand_and_gp):

> "To get a rough idea of how much sand to apply over the course of the year, we have developed a simple spreadsheet that uses growth potential (GP) as a guide, and a maximum sand application of 150 lbs dry sand/1000 ft<sup>2</sup> per month at maximum turf growth."

That maximum rate is about 0.5 mm per month, and it is based on the rates used by [Hempfling et al.](https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/cs/abstracts/57/2/602) in their research about topdressing and anthracnose.

In [the spreadsheet](https://www.paceturf.org/PTRI/Documents/Sand_GP_1.xls), one can adjust the maximum rate. I left the maximum rate at the default setting and entered temperature data for Bangkok. That gives a total annual topdressing amount of 1,656 lb/1000 ft<sup>2</sup>, or 5.4 mm. Seems like it's in the ballpark.
