On February 28, I planted `Wana' manilagrass as two node rhizomes in sand-filled pots. All pots have had irrigation and rainfall. One pot has not been fertilized. One has received only N from urea. Another pot has gotten N and P, from urea and from diammonium phosphate (DAP). The fourth pot has gotten all the macronutrients---N, P, and K---from urea and DAP and potassium chloride (KCl).

<small><strong>Algae covers the sand surface in pots supplied with P, 72 days after planting.</strong></small>

It seems there is plenty of K in the sand and in the irrigation water, because the grasses haven't had much growth response to added K. They definitely respond to P.

And so does the algae.

![manilagrass pots with algae where P has been supplied](/img/algae_p.jpg)
<small><strong>The manilagrass grows rapidly when P is supplied, but P addition has caused algae to grow too.</strong></small>

There was a hint that this would happen less than two weeks after planting.

It's obvious, by looking at how much the grass has grown in 72 days, that P supplied to this grass in this sand speeds establishment. Once grass is established, however, there are all kinds of reasons not to apply P, such as:

1. reduce algae risk

2. reduce pollution risk

3. reduce *Poa annua* invasion risk

4. save money

I'd look at the soil test P, and its change over time, comparing the soil P level to the [MLSN guideline](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2018-02-03-new-mlsn-cheat-sheet/) and evaluating turfgrass performance, before including any P in a fertilizer to established turf.
