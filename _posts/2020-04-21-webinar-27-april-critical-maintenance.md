I'll be teaching a webinar on April 27 for Campus del CÃ©sped about critical turfgrass maintenance this year. [Abstract and registration here](http://www.campusdelcesped.com/1/greenkeeping_1083548.html). This seminar will be available in Spanish and in English.

I'll be discussing the way I would approach turfgrass maintenance this year, and I'll use my book *A Short Grammar of Greenkeeping* as a guide. The book is available at a 50% discount through the end of April with [this coupon code](https://leanpub.com/short_grammar_of_greenkeeping/c/cesped).
