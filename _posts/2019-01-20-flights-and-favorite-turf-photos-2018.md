As I say at the end of every year, it was another extraordinary year for studying grass around the world.

In 2018 I took 107 flights for a total distance of 314,748 km (195,575 miles). That's an increase from 2017, when it was 78 flights and 205,043 km.

Earlier this month I scrolled through 3,959 photos from 2018 and selected some memorable ones.

![paspalum in the Andaman Sea](/img/jan_andaman.jpg)
<small>*January: Seashore paspalum lawn on an island in the Andaman Sea*</small>

There are also lawns of tropical carpetgrass (*Axonopus compressus*) and of manilagrass (*Zoysia matrella*) on this small island. Both the carpetgrass and manilagrass provided a better sward. The seashore paspalum here would probably make a better lawn if more irrigation water were supplied. That would increase the growth rate and allow the turf to fully cover the ground.

<small>*January: Creeping bentgrass putting green at the PGA Catalunya Resort*</small>

I made a quick visit to Girona and was impressed at how much bentgrass there was, and how little *Poa annua* I could find, on the greens here. I first went to Girona in 2012, and since then I've learned a lot from David Bataller and the maintenance team there.

![March sunrise 4](/img/mar_sunrise_4.jpg)
<small>*March: Native grasses (manilagrass, carpetgrass, golden false beardgrass, javagrass, and others that I don't know) on a golf course in southern Thailand*</small>

I bought an annual membership last week at this course in a beautiful part of southern Thailand. The course changes with the seasons, all kinds of colors from the rainy season to the dry season, and depending on which grasses are in flower and how recently the turf has been mown.

![manilagrass in Bangkok](/img/mar_manilagrass.jpg)
<small>*March: Putting green of manilagrass in central Bangkok*</small>

The photo here could have been me celebrating another birdie with the towers of Bangkok in the background. I made quite a few birdies in my rounds here last year. But this is just the grass. There are courses all over East and Southeast Asia with excellent manilagrass greens.

![manilagrass in May in eastern Thailand](/img/may_manilagrass.jpg)
<small>*May: Coconut palms and unmaintained manilagrass on an island in Trat Province, Thailand*</small>

I went to a number of islands in Thailand in 2018, both on the Pacific and Indian Ocean sides, and found plenty of nice grasses growing wild.

![sunset in Trat](/img/may_sunset.jpg)
<small>*May: Sunset on that same island after a long day of botanizing*</small>

Ok, this one doesn't have grass in the photo, but it was quite a sunset and it was on that same beach with the fine-bladed manilagrass. 

![bentgrass in Washington](/img/aug_bentgrass.jpg)
<small>*August: There is plenty of bentgrass in this unirrigated backyard on Orcas Island, Washington*</small>

This soil will typically be saturated from autumn to spring and then dries out in the summer. When allowed to grow up, it's apparent that there is a lot of bentgrass. I've never noticed *Poa annua* in this lawn.

![sunrise at Pebble Beach](/img/aug_sunrise.jpg)
<small>*August: A sunrise at Pebble Beach*</small>

I was at Pebble Beach for the US Amateur Championship and was impressed with the shadows at sunrise.

Colors at sunset were impressive too.

![sunrise shadows in Fukuoka](/img/fukuoka_morning.jpg)
<small>*August: Shadows at sunrise on manilagrass in Fukuoka*</small>

Another course in Asia with manilagrass greens. This is at Keya GC during the KBC Augusta tournament. 

![goto island tee shot](/img/sep_goto.jpg)
<small>*View from the tee on the 4<sup>th</sup> at Hirabaru GC in Nagasaki*</small>

There are some amazing golf courses that one won't find on maps. This is one of them. You [can read about it here](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2018-10-10-botanizing-nippon-treasure-links/).

![south end of Kashima Soccer Stadium](/img/oct18_kashima.jpg)
<small>*October: South end of Kashima Soccer Stadium, Ibaraki*</small>

There was new turf installed in early 2018 at Kashima Soccer Stadium and it performed great through the summer and into the autumn. Even the most shaded section of the pitch, with warm-season turf, was providing a fine surface in autumn.

![777 bentgrass and Mt. Fuji](/img/oct_fuji.jpg)
<small>*October: A 777 creeping bentgrass practice green near Mt. Fuji*</small>

Japan has a lot of golf courses set in spectacular landscapes. 

![Freud statue on a golf course](/img/dec_czech.jpg)
<small>*December: Sculpture on a golf course near Brno, Czech Republic*</small>

There is a sculpture of Sigmund Freud right near the first tee at the Kask√°da golf resort. Plenty of other stunning artwork at this facility. See [more here](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2018-12-14-mlsn-grammar-gp-clipvol-czech/).

![don't walk on grass sign, athens](/img/dec_athens.jpg)
<small>*December: An untrafficked lawn in Athens*</small>

This lawn has a *Cynodon* base with some winter annuals in it. My collection of "don't walk on the grass" sign photos is gradually increasing.
