These posts had the most views in 2020. Here they are, on all kinds of topics.

[1] February, [Soil organic matter: a bullet list](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2020-02-17-soil-organic-matter-bullet-list/), summarizing key points related to its measurement and its management at the soil surface.

[2] February, [Before your next calcium app, read this](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2020-02-23-before-next-calcium-app-read-this/) which points out that irrigation water contains, on average, *7 times more* Ca than the grass uses.

[3] July, [Hollow-tine cultivation and solid-tine spiking both failed to alleviate summer bentgrass decline](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2020-07-24-hollow-tine-solid-tine-both-fail-alleviate-summer-bentgrass-decline/) which was a surprise to a lot of people. 

[4] May, [Putting green organic matter by depth in the soil](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2020-05-13-putting-green-organic-matter-by-depth/) goes into more detail about this topic.

[5] May, [Algae, sand, and phosphorus](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2020-05-10-algae-sand-fertilizer/) shows how P and sand surfaces don't mix for long.

[6] April, [When grass grows more, it makes more roots](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2020-04-17-grass-grows-more-makes-roots/), which I think is useful to remember if one wants more roots.

[7] April, [Surface hardness of eight grass species on putting greens](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2020-04-19-density-plots-clegg-putting-greens/) in one simple chart.

[8] February, [Quacks and Suckers](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2020-02-24-quacks-and-suckers/) and let's hope we are neither.

[9] May, [Sand topdressing by growth rate and clipping volume](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2020-05-01-sand-topdressing-by-growth-rate/) which proposes adding 1 cm<sup>3</sup> of sand for every 1 cm<sup>3</sup> of clipping volume. That works out to 1 mm of sand for every 1 L/m<sup>2</sup> of clippings.

[10] April, [Four tools to measure surface hardness](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2020-04-18-surface-hardness-correlations/) describes the 4 tools and discusses their advantages and drawbacks. 

Those were the top 10 this year. Thanks to everyone for reading.
