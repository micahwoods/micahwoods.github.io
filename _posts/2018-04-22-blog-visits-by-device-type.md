There were 30,874 visitors to [www.asianturfgrass.com](http://www.asianturfgrass.com/) and [www.blog.asianturfgrass.com](http://www.blog.asianturfgrass.com/) since April 23 last year. Of those, 60% were from a mobile device, 33% from a desktop/notebook, and 7% were from a tablet.

I've been looking at this for a few years because it is interesting to see the trends, and because I want to make sure the content is optimized for as many visitors as possible.
