You may recall that I went [shopping for golf magazines at 4 a.m. on August 23](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2018-09-14-shopping-magazines-4am-7-11/). What was that about? There was a feature article in that week's new issue of *Weekly Golf Digest* about Andrew McDaniel.

I could get the gist of the article by looking at the photos. But I didn't realize it went into so much detail and stretched to such a length in English. Thanks to translator Yukio Ueno, this profile of Andrew McDaniel (assistant general manager and golf course superintendent at Keya GC in Fukuoka) from the September 4 issue of *Weekly Golf Digest* is now available in English.

The article makes an interesting turf read this weekend. Japan is the world's second largest golf market, after the United States, but there are a lot of misperceptions about it and few foreigners work on golf course maintenance in Japan. This article, titled "Greenkeeper with blue eyes," gives a Japanese perspective on an American working as a greenkeeper in Japan. In Japan, the person who is responsible for the care of a golf course is called a greenkeeper; the equivalent position in the United States would be golf course superintendent.

Previous articles about Andrew in the Japanese press have referred to him as a "[*kurofune*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Ships) keeper." There is an intriguing perspective in this "blue-eyed greenkeeper" article, both from the writer, and from the comments in the article by Andrew and by the people who work with him every day.
