I really enjoyed listening to Frank Rossi and Jim Brosnan discuss weed control, *Poa annua*, herbicide resistance, and glyphosate in their [recent discussion on TurfNet's Frankly Speaking](https://www.turfnet.com/podcasts/rossi/brosnan/).

I'd recommend listening to this to learn more about some important turfgrass management challenges and the research being done right now to find solutions. Here are a few quotes from the podcast, from their discussion about herbicide resistance:

Rossi: "almost 90% of the [*Poa annua* control] programs are breaking down in one way, shape, or form?"

Brosnan: "when this goes off the rails, it goes **way** off the rails"

Brosnan: "we want you to be diversifying what you're doing so you're not selecting for resistance on your golf course, but the answer to a resistance problem is not gonna come from a jug"
