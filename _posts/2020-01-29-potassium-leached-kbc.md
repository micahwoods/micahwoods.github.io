Monthly soil and leaf samples were collected from the 11<sup>th</sup> green at Keya Golf Club during the 2019 growing season. [Andrew McDaniel](https://twitter.com/drumcturf) and I wanted to look at the annual range of values, and changes over time, for soil and leaf nutrients.

Samples were taken on 21 August, just before the start of the [KBC Augusta Tournament](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2017-08-18-why-kbc-is-so-interesting/). On 21 August, the soil test K, measured by a Mehlich 3 extraction, was 89 mg/kg (ppm).

Then it rained a lot---a total of 374 mm (14.7 inches) fell between 21 August and the time another soil sample was collected on 1 September. There was rain on 10 of those 11 days between samplings, averaging 34 mm per day (1.33 inches per day).

So what happened with the soil K? Did a lot of it leach? 

No. The soil test K from the sample taken on 1 September was 88 ppm, down just 1 ppm from the amount in the soil on 21 August.

Most of the K extracted by Mehlich 3 is on cation exchange sites. And no matter how much it rains, cation exchange capacity won't be affected.
