In this month's roundup, fertilizer, roots, and salinity, the Pelzmeter, the amount of N in rain and snow, measuring clipping volume from putting greens, and much more.

Frank Rossi, Dan Dinelli, and Roch Gaussoin on [TurfNet Radio talking organic matter](http://www.turfnet.com/blog/4/entry-1422-dan-dinelli-and-dr-roch-gaussoin-role-and-management-of-organic-matter/).

A correspondent asked, about fertilizing based on soil salinity, "is there a particular reason [you think it's a poor way to fertilize?"](http://www.blog.asianturfgrass.com/2017/06/is-there-a-particular-reason-why-you-think-its-a-poor-way-to-fertilise.html)

About soil salinity, fertilizer, and [not jumping on bandwagons](http://www.blog.asianturfgrass.com/2017/06/dont-try-to-jump-on-his-bandwagon.html).

*Fertility* might not mean [what you think it does](http://www.blog.asianturfgrass.com/2017/06/tonights-reading.html).

Jason Haines says measurement of clipping volume is ["already proving to be more valuable that I originally expected"](http://www.blog.asianturfgrass.com/2017/06/already-proving-to-be-more-valuable-than-i-originally-expected.html).

And with all the measuring, he hasn't found any ["increase in time that it takes to cut the greens in the morning."](http://www.turfhacker.com/2017/06/differences-and-similarities-in-growth.html)

He also wrote about [growth rate and disease](http://www.turfhacker.com/2017/06/growth-and-disease-rates.html).

And [extreme growth rate turfnerdery](http://www.turfhacker.com/2017/06/extreme-growth-rate-turfnerdery.html).

Do the MLSN guidelines [include all 17 essential elements?](http://www.blog.asianturfgrass.com/2017/06/17-essential-nutrients.html)

Gypsum isn't required prior to [leaching salt from sand rootzones](http://www.blog.asianturfgrass.com/2017/06/no-matter-how-much-sodium-one-puts-into-a-sand-rootzone-the-soil-structure-cannot-be-affected-so-gyp.html).

I'm confident that when grass grows less, the [green speed will be faster](http://www.blog.asianturfgrass.com/2017/06/i-dont-really-need-to-show-any-data-for-this-to-be-certain.html).

Paul Robertson started an extraordinarily long and wide-ranging conversation with a simple question: [anyone using a Pelzmeter?](https://twitter.com/Vgclinks/status/878599481243062272)

["Sorry if this is a rubbish question,"](http://www.blog.asianturfgrass.com/2017/06/sorry-if-this-is-a-rubbish-question.html) a correspondent wrote, about different MLSN guidelines for different grass species.
