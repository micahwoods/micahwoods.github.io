One of the things I've noticed when growing grasses in pots is the striking difference between aboveground stolons produced by bermudagrass, and underground rhizomes produced by zoysiagrass.

<small><strong>These grasses were grown in pots and fertilized with N, P, and K. The Tifeagle bermudagrass at left produced a mass of aboveground stolons. The three varieties of manilagrass (*Zoysia matrella*) at right all produced a mass of belowground rhizomes.</strong></small>

This difference in growth habit has implications for wear recovery, divot recovery, and surface preparation in general. It's especially important to be aware of this when cutting sprigs for establishment.
