These posts had the most views in 2019. Here they are, counting down from ten to one.

[10] January, [Ranking Turf Twitter in 2018](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2019-01-31-ranking-of-turf-twitter-in-2018/) took a look at "influential" accounts in the industry.

[9] September, [Cleaning cores the easy way](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2019-09-16-cleaning-cores-the-easy-way/) shows the sweepers that are standard piece of equipment on Japanese golf courses.

[8] August, [Three reasons why sand topdressing is best expressed as a depth](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2019-08-08-three-reasons-sand-depth/) explains that a) depth standardizes for mass and over area; b) that depth can be directly related to soil organic matter; and c) this unit makes it easier to communicate about an important maintenance practice.

[7] August, [Ball bounce on greens after 7 days of rain](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2019-08-27-ball-bounce-after-7-days-of-rain/), which I never fail to be fascinated by when this is accomplished with only a couple topdressings in the year.

[6] August, getting [smoother fairways with a 10 ton vibratory roller](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2019-08-17-rolling-fairways-with-a-road-roller/) is not a big surprise.

[5] June, [Measuring organic matter](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2019-06-10-measuring-organic-matter/) discusses a few details related to organic matter measurement of high maintenance turf surfaces---especially golf course putting greens.

[4] July, [Post-rain growth flush from nitrogen in the rain or nitrogen from the soil](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2019-07-09-nitrogen-in-rain-or-nitrogen-from-the-soil/), in which I make the case for this to be almost certainly a mineralization and increased soil water content effect, and not because of N in the rain.

[3] September, [Core aerating putting greens, or not](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2019-09-29-core-aerate-greens/
) discusses that, and in particular my views on this topic.

[2] February, [Do you need to add beneficial microbes to the soil to make it function properly?](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2019-02-18-zuberer-beneficial-microbes/) Two comprehensives and accessible articles by David Zuberer suggest the answer is no.

[1] June, [This one simple trick can transform putting greens from usually good to consistently great](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2019-06-25-one-simple-trick-better-greens/), and it is part of what I call a [continuous improvement system](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2019-11-25-continuous-improvement-presentation/) for turfgrass.

Those were the top 10 this year. Thanks to everyone for reading.
