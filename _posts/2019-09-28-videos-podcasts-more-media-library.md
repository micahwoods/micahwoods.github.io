I've been a guest on a lot of shows, and have produced a lot of material myself. Over the years the videos and podcast episodes and presentation slide decks and books accumulate. With the new [Media Library](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/media/) page on the ATC website, I've put a lot of that material (and links to much more) all in one place.

The page includes 10 videos and links to ATC's Vimeo and YouTube pages.

It has links to 8 podcast episodes, to more than 75 presentation slide decks, and to 3 books.
