I misstated that irrigation water normally has 20 to 60 ppm (mg/L) potassium. That's incorrect. Potassium is normally 5 to 20 ppm, [according to Penn State's irrigation water quality guidelines](https://extension.psu.edu/irrigation-water-quality-guidelines-for-turfgrass-sites). It is calcium that normally has 20 to 60 ppm.
