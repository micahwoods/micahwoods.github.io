then you already know that I've fixed the [blog's e-mail updates](http://www.subscribepage.com/atc_blog_email) to show the full content. When I updated the website last July, I couldn't figure out how to get the full post text to show in the [RSS feed](http://www.asianturfgrass.com/feed.xml) -- that feed is what the e-mail updates are based on. I figured that out, and am pleased that one can now read the full post in the e-mail rather than an excerpt. 

This blog e-mail update is the most frequent of the e-mails from ATC. I checked the number of new posts since the new website went online, and on average there is a new post, and thus a blog e-mail update, every 3 days.

If you would like to sign up to that, you can [do so here](http://www.subscribepage.com/atc_blog_email).

ATC has less frequent newsletters as well.

* The [ATC updates newsletter](http://www.subscribepage.com/atcupdate) has been sent out, on average, every 96 days. That newsletter covers a broad range of turfgrass topics. You can see previous e-mails at the [ATC archives page](http://www.asianturfgrass.com/archive/).
* On a very specific subject, you can also [subscribe to the MLSN newsletter](http://www.subscribepage.com/mlsn). This one is only about the MLSN soil guidelines and their use -- it has been sent out with an average frequency of every 72 days.
* There is also an ATC updates newsletter in Japanese -- [日本語のATCアップデート](http://www.subscribepage.com/atcupdate_jp) -- this one I've sent every 126 days. And I paste the English text at the bottom of the newsletter, so this might even be of interest to those who don't read Japanese.

In addition to the newsletters, [www.asianturfgrass.com](http://www.asianturfgrass.com/) is the best way to follow our work. If you scroll all the way to the bottom of the page, you can also find links to all the ATC social media accounts.
