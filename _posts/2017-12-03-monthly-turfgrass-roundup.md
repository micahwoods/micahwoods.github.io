PACE Turf and Bill Kreuser point out that adding fertilizer in amounts the plant can use is the [recommended way](https://twitter.com/paceturf/status/932280385538465795):

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Don‚Äôt apply more fertilizer than the plant can use in the fall! Why apply more fertilizer than the plant needs at any time of the year? Apply just enough fertilizer to meet color and growth targets for good performance and minimum yield.

Cumulative rain and [bermudagrass quality](http://www.asianturfgrass.com/2017-11-16-bermudagrass-and-year-to-date-rain/).

Haines [explained the approach he used](http://www.turfhacker.com/2017/11/the-evolution-of-precision-fertilizer.html) to "cut my nitrogen rates in half without compromising turf quality, [and] I have seen reductions in turf diseases, thatch, required mowing, fuel use and labor."
