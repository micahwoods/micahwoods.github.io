Yesterday I wrote of tissue testing (or more specifically, *leaf nutrient analysis*) that "I don't like making nutrient application decisions" based on it and "I would not do routine tissue testing if I were a golf course superintendent.

I've got more to explain about why that is. But I need to get this out of the way first. When I was a graduate student, I wrote an article in which I wrote that tissue testing could be the final answer! 

This is the quote that I'd like to have back, from an article in the May 2004 *TurfNet Monthly* entitled [*Q&A: water-based extraction methods for turf soils*](http://www.files.asianturfgrass.com/woods_2004_turfnet_water_extraction.pdf):

> In general, I find it much more useful to look at soil test data as an indicator of available nutrients but to use tissue analysis as a means to detect nutrient deficiencies â€¦ Tissue tests tell us what the plant has, so there are no questions about whether a certain nutrient is available or not, deficient or not, or sufficiently mobile or not. In the tissue there are either adequate amounts or there are not. Final answer.

I've [already explained at length](http://www.blog.asianturfgrass.com/2016/02/this-is-not-a-very-good-article.html) many of the things I disagree with from that article. For tissue testing specifically, a big problem is know what are *adequate amounts*. When I wrote that article in 2004, I was convinced that [soil testing interpretation was broken](http://www.blog.asianturfgrass.com/2014/09/conventional-nutrient-guidelines-explaining-what-i-mean-by-broken.html), and the leaf nutrient guidelines -- which will classify almost every turf sample as adequate, by the way -- seemed at the time a better alternative. "Instead of all this fertilizer being recommended based on problems with soil test interpretation," I thought, "one can just do a tissue test, find that all is fine, and skip the unnecessary fertilizer." 

Now I wouldn't even go that far. I think tissue tests are likely to cause confusion, and for turf management, I'd rather focus on producing a surface, rather than on trying to adjust leaf nutrient levels.
