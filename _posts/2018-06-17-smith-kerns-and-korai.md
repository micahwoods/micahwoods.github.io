Yesterday I saw some dollar spot on a korai (*Zoysia matrella*) fairway in Kyushu, Japan. I wondered what the [Smith-Kern model](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0194216) probability for dollar spot had been.

So I looked up the recent temperature and humidity at a nearby weather station. Based on seeing the dollar spot on June 16, and finding that the model shows recent probabilities in the 0.2 to 0.3 range, it seems that the 0.2 (20%) threshold proposed by Smith et al. could be a reasonable starting point for korai as well.
