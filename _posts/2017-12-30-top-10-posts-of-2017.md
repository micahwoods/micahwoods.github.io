These 10 posts from 2017 had the most pageviews this year. Here they are, counting down from ten to one.

[10] June, [How much N is in rain and snow?](http://www.blog.asianturfgrass.com/2017/06/how-much-n-is-in-rain-and-snow.html) One hears all kinds of numbers. I was surprised to learn these data are regularly measured. There is no need to guess.

[9] August, [How to spend less than $5,000 on tournament green fertilizer](http://www.asianturfgrass.com/2017-08-23-how-to-spend-5000-tournament-green-fertilizer/). This was $982 for a granular application, $131 for more N, $176 for K, and $2,600 for kelp and micronutrients. 

[8] July, [Sward stimpmeter speed for seven species](http://www.asianturfgrass.com/2017-07-16-species-ease-speed/), about my ranking of seven species and the ease of achieving green speed with them.

[7] January, [Sand, leading to more growth, needing more sand, leading to more growth, needing more sand](http://www.blog.asianturfgrass.com/2017/01/sand-leading-to-more-growth-needing-more-sand-leading-to-more-growth-needing-more-sand.html), in which I suggest that adding more sand does not cause grass to grow more.

[6] December, [A non-comprehensive list of awesome turfgrass things other people did this year](http://www.asianturfgrass.com/2017-12-24-a-non-comprehensive-list-of-awesome-things-other-people-did-in-turfgrass-this-year/) which although being non-comprehensive, is still extensive. 

[5] June, [Of turf, roots, and fertilizer](http://www.blog.asianturfgrass.com/2017/06/of-turf-roots-and-fertilizer.html), in which I make three points about this topic.

[4] January, [This is one more post the financial controllers might not want to see](http://www.blog.asianturfgrass.com/2017/01/this-is-one-more-post-the-financial-controllers-might-not-want-to-see.html) about saving $150,000 and budget scrutiny.

[3] September, ["Potassium applications have been associated with increased winter diseases in northern climates"](http://www.asianturfgrass.com/2017-09-27-potassium-affects-microdochium-bentgrass/) about the surprising result of increased disease after potassium application.

[2] August, [Sand topdressing to match grass growth](http://www.asianturfgrass.com/2017-08-20-topdress-and-growth-potential/) about calculating sand topdressing amounts by growth potential (GP). This [metric version of the same topic](http://www.asianturfgrass.com/2017-09-03-topdressing-gp-metric/) also got a lot of views.

[1] July, [This will make you rethink what you throw in the spray tank](http://www.asianturfgrass.com/2017-07-06-rethink-throw-spray-tank-si/): in 11 attempts, silicon failed to increase green speed every single time.
