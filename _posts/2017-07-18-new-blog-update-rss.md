You may have noticed that new blog posts are at [www.asianturfgrass.com](http://www.asianturfgrass.com/). The 841 posts from the old blog remain at [www.blog.asianturfgrass.com](http://www.blog.asianturfgrass.com/).

If you were subscribed to the old blog by RSS feed or e-mail, the feeds have changed. [This is the new RSS feed](http://www.asianturfgrass.com/feed.xml) for this site.

And I made a new e-mail subscription for the blog. You [can subscribe here](http://www.subscribepage.com/atc_blog_email) to get an e-mail when there is a new post on the blog.
