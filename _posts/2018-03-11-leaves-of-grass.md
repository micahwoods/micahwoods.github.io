I've recorded the narrative for another set of presentation slides. [These](https://vimeo.com/micahwoods/clip1) are the slides I used for my presentation on this topic in Moncton last month. The audio I recorded today -- this is what I talked about during that presentation.

I'll be leading a webinar on this topic for TurfNet on April 23. You can [sign up here](https://register.gotowebinar.com/register/566385216936205571). I've given that presentation a title of *Five reasons you should measure the clipping volume*.
