Yesterday I wrote that [bermudagrass fairways in Thailand](http://www.asianturfgrass.com/2017-11-15-turf-around-the-world/) wouldn't be as good as they are in the Algarve because of climate differences. The cumulative rain so far this year makes a nice illustration of this.

These data are through early November, and Trang in southern Thailand had received 2708 mm (107 inches) of rain so far this year; Faro had received 232 mm (9 inches). One can expect bermudagrass to perform better as a closely-mown turfgrass when there is more sun and the soils are drier.

I was out for lunch in Trang a couple days ago. This rain isn't added to the chart yet.
