The [instructions from Rutgers](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2020-02-02-composite-samples-1/) are to take from 12 to 15 samples from a single putting green. I like to check Penn State recommendations too---their websites are a wealth of reference materials. A good starting point is the [Professional Turfgrass Management](https://plantscience.psu.edu/research/centers/turf/extension/professional-turf) page with its long list of documents. My favorite from that page is [*Turfgrass Fertilization: A Basic Guide for Professional Turfgrass Managers*](https://extension.psu.edu/turfgrass-fertilization-a-basic-guide-for-professional-turfgrass-managers).

On the [soil sampling instructions](https://agsci.psu.edu/aasl/soil-testing/fertility/soil-sampling-instructions) page, the instructions for turf soils are:

> "Using a soil sampling tube, auger or trowel, and a clean pail, obtain thin slices or borings of soil from 12 or more locations."

I'm not sure where the **12** comes from, but Penn State recommends a minimum of 12 subsamples be put together as a composite sample for an area, and so does Rutgers. This seems to be the standard recommendation.
