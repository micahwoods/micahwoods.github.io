In the ATC update sent earlier this week---[subscribe here](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/lists/) if you'd like to get on this list---I mentioned that one of the highlights of my year so far was the Royal Turf Family Seminar at the Park Hyatt Tokyo.

Mr. Hanzawa, the president of [Royal Turf Company](http://www.royalturf.co.jp/), had the presentations recorded. One of the things I discussed in my presentation was how one can use clipping volume to get an estimate for nutrient use and an estimate for N mineralization.

That starts at the [51:00 mark of the presentation video](https://vimeo.com/328385685#t=51m0s) and runs for 9 minutes. This includes the translation too, so if you don't understand Japanese, perhaps you can spend that time sipping coffee, or making some site-specific calculations based on grass and growth rates at your location.

The accuracy of those estimates depends on a few things, with the most important one being the conversion from clipping volume to clipping dry weight. I've written about this in [*One Bucket at a Time*](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/buckets/), Doug Soldat discussed this in his [Watching Your Grass Grow](https://gcsaa.interactyx.com/pages/course/portal.aspx?courseid=631) webinar for GCSAA, Bill Kreuser has [shared his results](https://twitter.com/UNLturf/status/1075836344038027265) on how to make the conversion, and the ongoing research about conversion equations will see them adjusted and refined.

This idea, that one can know the turf nutrient use from a single day, by checking the clipping volume, is a powerful one. The information can be especially applicable in summer, when grass is under heat stress.
