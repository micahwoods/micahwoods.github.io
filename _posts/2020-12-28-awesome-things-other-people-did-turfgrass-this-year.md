Here's a non-comprehensive list for this year. It's been awesome that turfgrass managers all over the world have found ways to continue to produce excellent turf conditions in a particularly difficult year. I've certainly missed lots of awesome things. Please comment, share, and reply about additional ones.

* Online turfgrass field days. I really appreciate the effort put into these by so many universities. What I was able to watch this year was really good. I especially enjoyed the videos from [Oregon State University](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHhEJD2IWTnp0GRMZEnYPpw/videos), with Chas Schmid on [long-term cultivation and topdressing](https://youtu.be/zTdmN6YqSgM), Alyssa Cain on [irrigation frequency and ET replacement on annual bluegrass](https://youtu.be/U4ayqJ6J8ds), and Clint Mattox with [summer notes on winter treatments](https://youtu.be/MLSvTctc6wk).

* [Clint's video](https://www.turfnet.com/turfnet-tv.html/winfieldtv/mattox/) for the Winfield Academy Prof Talk series was really good, too.

* Speaking of videos, how about Bjarni Hannesson's [generous offer](https://twitter.com/BHannesson/status/1339270936160313350?s=20) to help with audio issues on turf-related videos? "I will help for free!" he says.

* Also, Bjarni continues his so far quixotic endeavor to [understand frost damage](https://twitter.com/BHannesson/status/1318525178360532992?s=20).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Can the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/turfindustry?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#turfindustry</a> gather some real money to research frost damage properly? I just opened the course on frozen white greens, and now after the thaw, not a single damage to be seen. Full 4 ball every 10 min since dawn. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/isfrostdamageoverrated?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#isfrostdamageoverrated</a> <a href="https://t.co/VRTK65Mwd1">pic.twitter.com/VRTK65Mwd1</a></p>&mdash; Bjarni hannesson (@BHannesson) <a href="https://twitter.com/BHannesson/status/1318525178360532992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

* Beth Guertal did an excellent presentation for TurfNet on [what turfgrass takes from the soil](https://www.turfnet.com/webinar_archives.html/what-turfgrass-takes-from-the-soil-r217/).

* Andrew McDaniel's front lawn. 

* Frank Rossi continues to share really good content and new ideas. I especially enjoyed [his presentation for the ASTMA](https://youtu.be/iMtn6_Uxm3o), his year-in-review [for TurfNet](https://www.turfnet.com/webinar_archives.html/frank-s-rossi-phd-2020-the-year-in-review-r233/), and all the [interesting things discussed](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2020-08-20-what-do-ninja-tines-poacure-mlsn-disease-models-clipvol/) on his Frankly Speaking show this year.

* How about [Ken Benoit's](https://twitter.com/kenbenoit1) ride across the United States this year, on his Connect to Protect Tour?

* Ken Benoit and Ken Nice, [discussing philosophy of turf management at Bandon Dunes](https://youtu.be/5qKE8VE_8T4).

* Jason Haines kept on learning, or innovating, and generously [sharing with everyone](http://www.turfhacker.com/). I especially enjoyed his mower productivity series, and his [in-depth look](http://www.turfhacker.com/2020/09/genki-vs-growth-ratio-is-game-changer.html) at how surprisingly useful it is to get the growth rate just right.

* Josep Cirera Clotet put together an [amazing image of turfgrass winter color](https://twitter.com/josepcirera/status/1218189209518977024) near Barcelona.

* Anne Falk Øgaard and Trygve Aamlid's article on [phosphorus requirements for bentgrass establishment and spring growth](https://doi.org/10.1002/agj2.20288) was published. 

* A review article by Emily Bock and Zachary Easton on [export of nitrogen and phosphorus from golf courses](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.109817) is an excellent article on this important topic.

* Max Schlossberg and twitterless Nate Leiby are also doing [interesting research about P](https://twitter.com/TurfNutrition/status/1257496297399111686?s=20) and I look forward to reading [more about it](https://scisoc.confex.com/scisoc/2020am/prelim.cgi/Paper/126947).

* Martin Nilsson shared some great photos of deer and of turf conditions this year --- he made the slides available for his BTME [presentation on Chemical Free Greenkeeping](https://speakerdeck.com/armadilloen/chemical-free-greenkeeping-amongst-2400-deer) and I think everyone involved in golf will like to scroll through those, if only to see the deer.

* Chris Tritabaugh also keeps trying new things. [First sand of the year](https://twitter.com/ct_turf/status/1291335419221745665?s=20) more than halfway through the year? What!?!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The sand applied with this week’s aerification, is the first bit of sand applied to putting surfaces this season. I used to think regular topdressing was a necessity, I no longer believe it to be true. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/hngcturf?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#hngcturf</a> <a href="https://t.co/f120bb2tWi">pic.twitter.com/f120bb2tWi</a></p>&mdash; Chris Tritabaugh (@ct_turf) <a href="https://twitter.com/ct_turf/status/1291335419221745665?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 6, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

* Jim Brosnan [wrote about *Poa annua*](https://medium.com/@UTTurfWeeds/poa-annua-im-still-here-b8d07199c173) and some of the exciting work he and graduate students in his lab are doing. It's Poa365 in his lab, and that post explains why.

* Grad students do much of the important and interesting turfgrass research, and [Paige Boyle](https://peboyle.wixsite.com/boyledworms) is especially good at sharing what she and others are doing.

* I also enjoyed the progress of Tyler Carr's [zoysiagrass grow-in](https://twitter.com/TylerTalksTurf/status/1283419171217440768?s=20). Maybe time for a year-end update?

* Sami Strutt did an excellent job putting together BIGGA's National Regional Conference---I know from having participated in that. I know for other conferences, and other virtual events put on this year or planned for next year, there has been a lot of excellent work done by many people. I certainly appreciate that when I get to see and learn from wherever I happen to be.

* And to circle back to the online field days, I recently watched the Michigan State University one, and there is a great segment [about MLSN & SLAN research](https://youtu.be/mZbLqt9Zfik?t=3024) by Jackie Guevara.

* [Jon Scott](https://twitter.com/jonscott7549/with_replies) is back on Twitter. He's reliably positive and wise, and I'm glad when someone with so much turfgrass knowledge can contribute.
