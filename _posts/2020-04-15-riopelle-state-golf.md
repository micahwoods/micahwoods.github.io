Jim Riopelle wrote an excellent article in the January/February issue of [Turf & Rec](https://mydigitalpublication.com/publication/?i=649547&ver=html5&p=21) magazine.

[![title of Riopelle article on the state of golf: a super's outlook](/img/riopelle_turf_rec.jpg)](https://mydigitalpublication.com/display_article.php?id=3599146&view=649547)

You'll want to read the full article. Here are a few quotes:

> I've experienced the good times in our industry but more recently have seen a beleaguered industry, as our core players age, younger people don't play, and revenues struggle to keep up with expenses ... 

> So I thought it was time [to offer] a few practical solutions to help courses survive---what looks like---a permanent downturn ... I will list a few based on my 35 years of experience as a golf course superintendent ...

> We have marvelous technology available to us today that needs to be utilized to its fullest potential. I'll give a shameless plug to the ["Greenkeeper" app](https://www.greenkeeperapp.com/marketing/) (free) and ["Turf Log"](http://www.precision-data-services.com/turf-log) (inexpensive) that are both wonderful apps for greens departments ...

> There are no magic bullets in plant nutrition. Decipher your soil test results and get back to basics when it comes to plant nutrition ... If your soil test results don't show P or K deficiencies, then why purchase a fertilizer that contains them? ...

> Retain a good mechanic. They are worth their weight in gold.

I found out about this article last week. Jim wrote to me right after I'd sent the 12<sup>th</sup> MLSN newsletter---[subscribe here](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/lists/), or [read MLSN newsletter #12 here](https://preview.mailerlite.com/m6c2b0).

> In response to your MLSN newsletter #12 I offer the following article I wrote and was published in Turf & Recreation Jan/Feb 2020 issue. My article starts on page 21. I thought it might be useful considering you mentioned cost savings in the newsletter. 

> BTW, I wish MLSN was around 30 years ago. The money I could have saved. I can't even think about it. Keep up the great work!
