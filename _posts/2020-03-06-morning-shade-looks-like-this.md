The PPFD (photosynthetic photon flux density) every 5 minutes for a day, week, month, and year at Corvallis looks like [this](http://www.blog.asianturfgrass.com/2015/06/this-is-what-par-looks-like.html). I'm not so interested in the PPFD when the [temperatures are too cold or too hot](http://www.blog.asianturfgrass.com/2015/06/which-more-effect-growth-light-or-temperature.html) for photosynthesis. I selected only those times in 2014 when the C<sub>3</sub> growth potential (GP) was greater than or equal to 0.5 (on a scale of 0 to 1), and the PPFD by time of day looks like this:

What happens when there is shade in the morning that blocks 80% of the PPFD, from sunrise until 2 hours before solar noon? What does the PPFD by time of day look like then?
