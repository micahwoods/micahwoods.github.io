I showed the appearance of two greens-type grasses---Tifeagle and a greens-type manuligrass---[in this post](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2019-10-29-fertilizer-response-at-planting/). That post included photos of the grasses 28 days after planting when fertilized with N only, with N + P + K, and with N + P + K + dolomite.

I've now received photos of these grasses from [#ATC南店](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ATC%E5%8D%97%E5%BA%97?src=hashtag_click) at 45 days after planting.

It is interesting to see the difference in growth between ultradwarf bermudagrass and a greens-type manilagrass. It is also interesting to see what happens to ultradwarf bermudagrass when the grass is not supplied with enough nutrients to match its potential growth rate. The manilagrass grows a lot slower, but at some point I expect to notice some differences between fertilizer treatments with that grass too.

For more about nutrient supply and how to ensure such deficiencies are prevented, the ["fertilizer"](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/tags/#fertilizer) tag on this blog has plenty of relevant articles.

And about manilagrass growth rate, [I made a video](https://vimeo.com/micahwoods/sena).
