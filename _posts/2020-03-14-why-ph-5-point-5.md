I almost always recommend keeping the soil pH above 5.5. This minimizes soluble aluminum in the soil, which can be toxic to roots. Get the soil pH above 5.5, and the soluble aluminum won't be very soluble anymore---it drops almost to 0.

This week I received test results from [Brookside Labs](https://www.blinc.com/) for five golf course clients. Plotting the soil pH (measured in a 1:1 solution with H<sub>2</sub>O) and the KCl-extractable aluminum, you'll see just how dramatically that Al<sup>3+</sup> drops as the pH gets above 5.5.

Another reason to keep the pH above 5.5 is to optimize microbial activity. Once the pH gets above 5.5, I'm not especially worried about it. 

What's the case when I don't mind pH less than 5.5? It would be an anti-*Poa* measure, if one has *Agrostis* that is performing well, and one is trying to stress *Poa*. But I'd rather stress the *Poa* in other ways, for example by [withholding P](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2019-12-21-can-you-see-the-p/).
