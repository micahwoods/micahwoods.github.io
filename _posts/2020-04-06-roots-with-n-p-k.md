The N-only pot looked pretty good when I showed [roots after 184 days](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2020-04-03-roots-p-k-deficient-grass/). 

But that same grass grew a lot more, and produced a lot more underground roots and rhizomes, when P and K were added.

You'll notice in the image sequence above that the manilagrass supplied with N, P, and K almost had full cover of the pot by January 9. At 100 days after planting, the grass with N-P-K had about the same ground coverage as the N-only grass did at 184 days.

There's a lot more undergound plant material too, when the grass is not deficient in N, P, or K.

I arranged the images side-by-side for comparison.
