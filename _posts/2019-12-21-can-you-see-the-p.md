The MLSN guideline for phosphorus (P) is 21 ppm. I usually recommend enough P fertilizer to keep soil P, as measured by the Mehlich 3 extractant, from dropping below 21 ppm.

But there's another way to decide when to apply P. That's by looking at the grass. Can you see the **P** in this image?

<small><strong>The letter "P" on this creeping bentgrass green at the O.J. Noer Turfgrass Research and Education Facility in Madison, Wisconsin, was caused by an application of P; the darker turf around the letter "P" did not receive P.</strong></small>

One can wait to see a deficiency, which is evident as turf that gets a purple tint, or grows a bit less, or has a darker color. When those deficiency symptoms are observed, one can correct the deficiency by applying P.

For example, I've been growing some variegated *Axonopus compressus* at [#ATC南店](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ATC%E5%8D%97%E5%BA%97?src=hashtag_click) and when I returned from a long trip on 5 December, I saw this grass had symptoms that looked like a P deficiency.

On 6 December, I added a bit of diammonium phosphate and urea to this pot of grass. Then I left on another trip. When I came back on 19 December, the purple color was gone, and the grass was back to normal---green leaves with light-colored stripes. That purpling went away after adding N and P. I'd guess this removal of purple color was caused by supplying P rather than by the N.

I wrote above that *I usually recommend enough P* to stay above 21 ppm. That's pretty much guaranteed to prevent any visual symptoms of P deficiency. And I think that is the way most professional turfgrass managers would like to keep their turf---without have to worry about a visual deficiency showing up. There is a particular case when I do suggest waiting to see a P deficiency before applying P. That is when one is trying to prevent *Poa annua* invasion. More about that in a future, and probably longer, post. But I thought these photos were interesting and wanted to share them today.
