There is an interesting thread on Twitter, started by Mike Richardson, about [turfgrass terminology](https://twitter.com/ArkansasTurf/status/1042403414930587648). He was asked why "we write grass names such as bermudagrass or zoysiagrass as single words when they are, in fact, grasses?" Aaron Patton answered that, showing a screenshot from a 1962 Agronomy Journal article on that very topic.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The answer is found in this reference.

PACE Turf (Larry Stowell, I presume) [asked a related question](https://twitter.com/paceturf/status/1044798861334654976) about the etymology of turf grass vs. turfgrass. That's a good one, because it should almost always be turfgrass, but spellchecking software will often flag **turfgrass**  as incorrect, and suggest a change to **turf grass** instead.

[Madison wrote about this](http://tic.msu.edu/tgif/flink?recno=255 ) in his introduction to *Practical Turfgrass Management*:

Then I looked up the 1952 and 1953 committee reports, just to be sure. 

In 1952, here's the start of the report from the **TURF** committee.

In 1953, the report is now from the **TURFGRASS** committee, and it ends with the explanation quoted by Madison.
