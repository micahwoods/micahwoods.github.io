When I was reading the 1952 report of the "Turf Committee" from that year's annual meeting of the American Society of Agronomy, I was looking specifically for use of the word turf, or turf grass, or turfgrass. This 1952 report was the final one from the "turf committee;" by 1953 [they would recommend use of the word "turfgrass."](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2018-09-28-turf-grass-or-turfgrass/)

I came across other remarks in the 1952 report that are interesting and perhaps even relevant today. Some recommendations from the committee included:

* vigorous attacks from every quarter against the flagrant merchandising of nostrums
* grow good grass to minimize weed problems
* It's unwise to promote soil conditioning materials wih a nearly complete lack of research data
* research programs will do well to determine "MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS" in everything. Those were *their* capital letters too, not mine.
* and the wonderful "Twilight Zone" comments, for what we today call the "transition zone"
