When I was reading the 1952 report of the "Turf Committee" from that year's annual meeting of the American Society of Agronomy, I came across other remarks that are interesting and perhaps even relevant today. This was the final report of the "turf committee"; by 1953 [they would recommend use of the word "turfgrass."](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2018-09-28-turf-grass-or-turfgrass/)

Some recommendations from the committee in their 1952 report included:

* vigorous attacks from every quarter against the flagrant merchandising of nostrums
* grow good grass to minimize weed problems
* soil conditioning materials wih a nearly complete lack of research data, unwise
* research programs will do well to determine "MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS" in everything. Those were *their* capital letters too, not mine.
* and the wonderful "Twilight Zone" comments, for what we today call the "transition zone"
