Someone asked me that when we were working at a golf tournament last month. The best way depends on just how much info you want, or how often you want to hear from me/ATC. 

Here are 10 sources of info, ranked in approximate order from most frequent info stream to least frequent.

1. The [@asianturfgrass](https://twitter.com/asianturfgrass) account on Twitter will have links to all my new blog posts, reshares of some old topical ones, and some retweets and other turf discussion.

2. The [Asian Turfgrass Center website](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/) has hundreds of posts about turfgrass info and ideas of all types. New information goes up, on average, about 100 times a year.

3. You can automatically get an email with the text of each new website update with the [ATC blog by email](http://www.subscribepage.com/atc_blog_email) newsletter.

4. Scroll to the bottom of the [ATC website](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/) to see links for all of ATC's social media accounts, a link to email us, the RSS feed to the blog, etc.

5. One of those social media accounts is [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/asianturfgrass/). John Kaminski told me that the asianturfgrass account just might be the most boring one ever. So check it out. It's just grass photos or videos, generally, with some captions. And I try not to cross post any photos here.

6. The [ATC updates newsletter](http://www.subscribepage.com/atcupdate) is sent out by email a few times a year, with a summary of the most interesting things I've been working on, or that I've read, seen, or written.

7. There is also a [MLSN newsletter](http://www.subscribepage.com/mlsn) that is just about the MLSN soil nutrient guidelines.

8. There is an [ATC updates newsletter](http://www.subscribepage.com/atcupdate_jp) in Japanese too. I include the original English text at the bottom of this newsletter, so if you just can't get enough info, and would like to know what I'm sending to people in Japan, you can sign up to that too!

9. Books. I've got [two books available now](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/books/) and am always working on getting more.

10. Have you ever checked out [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JAlxOXEAAAAJ&hl=en)? That link has a lot of technical articles I've written or co-authored. And there are even more---212 to be exact, as of today---at the [Turfgrass Information File](http://tic.lib.msu.edu/tgif/flink?name=Woods,%20Micah).
