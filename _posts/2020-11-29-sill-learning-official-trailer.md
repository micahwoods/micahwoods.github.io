Some of you saw this film at its first screening during BIGGA's National Regional Conference. On 8 December, the "Still Learning" film is coming to screens worldwide. 

And now, [here is the *official* trailer](https://vimeo.com/micahwoods/learningtrailer).

It hasn't won any awards yet, but I'm starting with the thank you speech right now. This wouldn't have been possible without the collaborative efforts of so many great people --- Andrew McDaniel, Dr. Leah Brilman, Dr. Beth Guertal, the inimitable Chris Tritabaugh. And Bjarni Hannesson, what can I say? Not only did he shine in one of the movie's best scenes, he also performed some audio engineering magic on the entire soundtrack. I watched the full movie again yesterday, with headphones on. Wow. And to Matthew Wharton and Jon Scott, two (lucky?) audience members from the initial screening, who provided such valuable feedback. Of course I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge Sami Strutt and the entire BIGGA team, for inviting me to produce this film. Who would have thought, when we first had the idea so many months ago, that the film would come out so well.
