I recently completed an analysis of Turf Twitter in 2019, with the [searchable results in this Shiny app](https://asianturfgrass.shinyapps.io/turf_twitter_2019/). 

Based on the number of followers, mentions of the account, the favorites and retweets and quotes of that accounts' tweets, and the number of tweets sent from the account, these are the [top 50 "influential" accounts](https://twitter.com/asianturfgrass/status/1213109021747503105) for 2019:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I looked at more than 1 million original tweets sent in 2019 from 5,773 active <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TurfTwitter?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TurfTwitter</a> accounts. The summary calculations, and more details, are in this searchable and sortable app <a href="https://t.co/zalg4512IW">https://t.co/zalg4512IW</a> <a href="https://t.co/gat5FWY1Az">pic.twitter.com/gat5FWY1Az</a></p>&mdash; Micah Woods (@asianturfgrass) <a href="https://twitter.com/asianturfgrass/status/1213109021747503105?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 3, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
