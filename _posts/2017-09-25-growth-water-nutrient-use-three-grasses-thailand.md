There are a variety of grasses used for lawns and sports turf in central Thailand. I gave a presentation last week at the American Society for Horticultural Science annual meeting about the growth of three of those grasses:

* 'nuan noi' manilagrass (*Zoysia matrella*)
* 'Tifway 419' bermudagrass (*Cynodon dactylon* x *C. transvaalensis*)
* 'salam' seashore paspalum (*Paspalum vaginatum*)

[These are the slides](https://speakerdeck.com/micahwoods/nutrient-use-water-use-and-growth-of-manilagrass-hybrid-bermudagrass-and-seashore-paspalum-turfgrass-in-central-thailand) and [this is the abstract](https://ashs.confex.com/ashs/2017/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/27386) for the talk.

The manilagrass grew the most in this experiment, which we ran for 48 days. All the grasses were supplied with a weekly rate of 1 g N m<sup>-2</sup>, and K was added to supply half, the same, and twice the amount of N. This plot shows the relationship between tissue K content and the daily growth rate.

Although the treatments to the grasses were different N:K ratios, the larger differences were the amount of growth between the grasses themselves.

I understand that the presentation audio was recorded and I'll share that when it is available.
