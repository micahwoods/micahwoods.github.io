I've gathered some collections of tweets into *moments* for easy viewing in sequence. I previously arranged these on Storify, but that service has shut down. Here's a quick description of these moments. 

## [Most important time of day for sun to reach turf](https://twitter.com/i/moments/990067045747212288)

I use a full year of weather data (on 10 minute intervals!) to explain the connection between air temperature and photosynthetically active radiation. This is related to [my hypothesis](http://www.blog.asianturfgrass.com/2015/02/a-hypothesis-concerning-the-most-important-time-for-sunlight-to-fall-on-turfgrass.html) about the most important time for sun to fall on turfgrass.

## [Soil temperature and soil water content](https://twitter.com/i/moments/990116566418124802)

[I've thought, perhaps mistakenly](https://twitter.com/asianturfgrass/status/746667637820665857), that a soil with less water (lower VWC) would cool down more at night than would that same soil containing more water.

I describe how I downloaded a year of hourly observations and found that the soil temperature didn't change in the way that I expected.

## [What's the irrigation water requirement?](https://twitter.com/i/moments/990138727560200193)

The irrigation water requirement for a location is a number, a depth (or volume) of water expected to be required to produce a certain level of turfgrass performance given the site and climate. 

There are different ways to calculate the irrigation water requirement, and I describe in this moment why the daily soil water balance method returns a number that I trust. If you would like to try this out for yourself, I also have a couple of Shiny apps, such as [this one](https://asianturfgrass.shinyapps.io/irrigation/), that show how the irrigation requirement changes based on changes such as rootzone depth, distribution uniformity, and what I call *irrigation rules*.

## [Top 25 turfgrass tweets of the 2016 Ryder Cup](https://twitter.com/i/moments/990131921807011841)

Immediately after the Ryder Cup, I counted the "likes" on 4,098 tweets about the turfgrass maintenance for the event. Specifically, these were tweets about or by the course superintendent [Chris Tritabaugh](https://twitter.com/ct_turf). The moment puts together the 25 with the most "likes" at the time I made the count. More details about [that here](http://www.blog.asianturfgrass.com/2016/10/top-25-tweets-of-the-ryder-cup.html).

## [BCSR quotes](https://twitter.com/i/moments/990126939061940224)

In August 2016, [Travis Shaddox](https://twitter.com/TravisShaddox) sent a stream of tweets with quotes from all kinds of publications about the base cation saturation ratio---BCSR. I put these tweets together into one moment. Read through [these](https://twitter.com/i/moments/990126939061940224) and I don't think you'll want to use that method of soil test interpretation.

## [Measuring #ClipVol at KBC Augusta](https://twitter.com/i/moments/990124653527023616)

Measuring grass growth by taking a quick and routine measurement of clipping volume, or [#ClipVol](https://twitter.com/hashtag/clipvol?src=hash), is a useful technique. This moment brings together a series of tweets describing how this was done at the 2016 KBC Augusta tournament in Japan.

John Kaminski has put together a [few moments too](https://twitter.com/iTweetTurf/moments). Do you know any other good turfgrass stories told or archived this way? This seems like it could be a useful way to organize the best tweets from a particular event, or to describe a particular project or maintenance practice.
