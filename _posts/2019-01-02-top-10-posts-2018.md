These posts had the most views in 2018. Here they are, counting down from ten to one.

[10] November, [Kurofune keeper](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2018-11-17-kurofune-keeper/) about the feature article on Andrew McDaniel in *Weekly Golf Digest*. That post has a download link for the article; it's also available [here](http://www.files.asianturfgrass.com/andrew_digest_2018.html) in an easy-reading format.

[9] November, [Humbug, the MLSN movie](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2018-11-29-humbug-the-mlsn-movie/). This was a fun project, producing and playing the lead role in a [film about MLSN](https://vimeo.com/micahwoods/humbug). If you haven't seen this yet, please have a watch this winter. As [the trailer](https://vimeo.com/micahwoods/humbugshort) shows, it's got drama, unbounded optimism, humour, international intrigue, and even ice cream.

[8] July, [A pleasant day, with an unpleasant termination](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2018-07-10-pleasant-day-unpleasant-termination/). Of the top 10 posts, I'd choose this one as my personal favorite. It's about something applicable everywhere---playing conditions and the type of work required to achieve the desired conditions. And as I wrote, "surely this is not the only place where this can happen?"

[7] March, [Leaves of Grass](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2018-03-11-leaves-of-grass/). This is the narrative for a presentation I made about the applications and implications of clipping volume.

[6] May, [The probability of a dollar spot epidemic](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2018-05-30-probability-of-dollar-spot/). This explains how the Smith-Kerns Dollar Spot Prediction Model works and shows some charts of calculations for this model.

[5] December, [Autonomous mower at 12 mm produced higher quality turf, increased shoot density, and reduced energy use compared to a conventional reel mower](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2018-12-08-produced-higher-quality-turf-autonomous/). I was surprised when I read the results from the article discussed in this post.

[4] April, [Learn the rules like a pro, so you can break them like an artist](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2018-04-05-five-articles-every-greenkeeper-should-read/). This is also a list of five articles that I think every greenkeeper should read. 

[3] April, [The case for reactive greenkeeping](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2018-04-01-is-reactive-better-than-proactive/). I wrote,

> Here's the problem. When we make things happen with the grass, we invariably overdo things. That's the only safe way to take a proactive approach.

And I suggested that reframing the work in terms of being reactive, rather than proactive, may be an excellent approach.

[2] May, [Is carbon "the next frontier in fertilization?"](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2018-05-31-is-carbon-the-next-frontier-in-fertilization/) This is a fascinating article by Bryan and Tyler Hopkins, ranging from photosynthesis to soil health to glyphosate to urea. And, of course, carbon. 

[1] February, [New MLSN cheat sheet](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2018-02-03-new-mlsn-cheat-sheet/). I thought it might be useful to summarise the key details of MLSN in a cheat sheet. So I made one.

Those were the top 10 this year. Thanks to everyone for reading.
