I talked about how I would manage grass in 2020. It turns out to be a lot of the things I usually talk about: growing the grass at just the right rate, supplying the amount of water and nutrients necessary to produce that rate, and managing grass by reacting to existing circumstances. I also made some calculations of expected nutrient use, and the cost for those nutrients. 

Pro tip: you'll have amazing turf conditions for less than €250/ha/year---that's about $120/acre/year---with urea and DAP and KCl.
