The KBC Augusta tournament is coming up next week at [Keya Golf Club](http://www.keyagc.co.jp/index.html) in Fukuoka. The volume of grass clippings cut from the greens is measured every morning.

I think it is interesting to look at the [density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function) of the measurements. This [joyplot](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggjoy/vignettes/introduction.html) provides a quick summary of clipping volume during the 2016 tournament.

The joyplot above uses the same data as this chart I made last year.
