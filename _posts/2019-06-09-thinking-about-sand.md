How much sand is required as topdressing? And how does one determine what that amount should be? The amount of sand necessary must be the amount required to optimize playing conditions for the most days out of the year, and simultaneously must be the amount required to manage the soil organic matter at the desired level.

Something else I've been thinking about---what is the best way to measure the organic matter?
