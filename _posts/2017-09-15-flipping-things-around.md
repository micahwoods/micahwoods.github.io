One can look at the growth of the grass, as approximated by the clipping volume, in a couple of ways. There's the quantity of clippings -- *here's how much the grass is growing*. I think that's the typical way to look at it.

But I find it useful sometimes to flip things around, and think about what produced that growth. Let's say for a particular turf area, for an upcoming event, I want to have a clipping volume of about 1.5 L/100 m<sup>2</sup>/day. Let's say that's the amount of clippings I want to produce for a monthlong duration. That'll be about 45 L/100 m<sup>2</sup>/month. 

How much nitrogen (N) will it take to produce that much growth?

For creeping bentgrass, I expect that will be just over 1 g N/m<sup>2</sup>. To get that much growth on korai (all the pictures in this post are korai), I expect the grass will use about 1.5 g N/m<sup>2</sup>.

By knowing how much growth one wants, and about how much N it takes to produce that much growth, one can be a little more precise with the turf management.
