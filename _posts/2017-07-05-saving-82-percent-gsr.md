When my friend wrote to ask if I could "write a brief description of MLSN," I thought I might send along the article on turfgrass fertilization from the *Green Section Record* by Meentemeyer and Whitlark. 

"Did I already write about that?" I wondered. Yes, I did. And I'm reminded of the absolutely incredible case study from the article. The course they describe was spending around $90,000 per year on liquid fertilizer applied to 1.6 ha of greens. After two years, the cost was down to $15,751. 

Here's [the original post](http://www.blog.asianturfgrass.com/2016/05/how-to-save-82-on-fertilizer-cost.html):

> There is another good article in the [*Green Section Record*](http://gsr.lib.msu.edu/), this one by Blake Meentemeyer and Brian Whitlark on [Turfgrass Fertilization](http://gsrpdf.lib.msu.edu/ticpdf.py?file=/article/meentemeyer-whitlark-turfgrass-5-6-16.pdf). You'll want to read the full article. It talks about the overall goals of fertilizer application, soil tests, some myth busting, fertilizer and playability, and more. It's a modern article with a lot of historical references too.

> The most interesting part of the article for me was the economic case study. A course reduced the putting green fertilizer cost by 82% and the result was "the putting greens have never been healthier."
