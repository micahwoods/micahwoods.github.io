There's an interesting article by Espevig et al. on [Effects of rolling and N-fertilization on dollar spot and Microdochium patch on golf greens in Scandinavia](https://doi.org/10.1051/bioconf/20201800008).

* rolling a red fescue green two times a week reduced dollar spot by 61% compared to no rolling
* rolling four times a week reduced dollar spot by 95%
* increasing annual N on a creeping bentgrass + *Poa annua* green from 15 to 24 g/m<sup>2</sup> reduced dollar spot by 24% **but**
* the following spring saw twice as much Microdochium patch on the plots which received the higher N rate

There are a number of surface performance benefits that come from rolling, and disease suppression is one of them.

With N fertilizer, I'd think of it in terms of [how much growth](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2017-09-15-flipping-things-around/) one expects to get from a given amount of N. 

And while we are on the subject of rolling, how about circle rolling this green, [NASCAR style](https://twitter.com/asianturfgrass/status/1239803548835016705?s=20), in Thailand.

Here's a similar type of roller on a football pitch near Bangkok.

If you are really into rolling, this post shows [a heavy roller on fairways](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2019-08-17-rolling-fairways-with-a-road-roller/).
