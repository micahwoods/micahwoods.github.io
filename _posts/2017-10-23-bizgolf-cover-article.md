I spoke with [Aman Misra](https://theamanmisra.wordpress.com/) in August for an article he was writing for [Bizgolf](https://issuu.com/gecmediagroup/docs/bizgolf_sep_2017) magazine. That article made it onto the cover, as "The 'other' Woods." You can browse the entire issue [here](https://issuu.com/gecmediagroup/docs/bizgolf_sep_2017), or [download the article as a pdf here](http://www.files.asianturfgrass.com/201709_bizgolf_other_woods.pdf).

I enjoyed reading the article, and would like to make just one correction. Either I misspoke, or Aman misheard -- the 1997 Open Championship was at Royal Troon, not at Royal Birkdale. What fond memories I have of that week! That was my first time to see links surfaces.
