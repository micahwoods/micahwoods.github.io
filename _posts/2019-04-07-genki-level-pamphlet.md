I put the series of genki level (GL) [blog posts](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/tags/#genki+level) together into [this 17 page pamphlet](http://files.asianturfgrass.com/201904_genki_level.pdf).

The pamphlet explains how one can calculate the genki level as the actual N supplied as fertilizer compared to a *standard* amount of N for that time duration. It goes on to describe how this genki level is an indication of how much one is pushing the grass to grow, and how one can compare that to how much the grass really is growing, and how may use this information to adjust the maintenance.
