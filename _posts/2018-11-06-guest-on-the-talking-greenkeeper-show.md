[Joe Gulotti](https://twitter.com/hardg43) had me as a guest on his [The Talking Greenkeeper](http://thetalkinggreenkeeper.libsyn.com/website/episode-6-micah-woods) show this week. 

We talked about elephant footprints, the MLSN soil nutrient guidelines, measuring clipping volume, my book [*A Short Grammar of Greenkeeeping*](https://leanpub.com/short_grammar_of_greenkeeping), the temperature-based turfgrass growth potential, this year's challenging weather, whether one needs to core and topdress putting green turf, where a #TurfFights episode might be staged, and much more.
