[Joe Gulotti](https://twitter.com/hardg43) had me as a guest on his [The Talking Greenkeeper](http://thetalkinggreenkeeper.libsyn.com/website/episode-6-micah-woods) show this week. 

We talked about elephant footprints, the MLSN soil nutrient guidelines, measuring clipping volume, my book [*A Short Grammar of Greenkeeping*](https://leanpub.com/short_grammar_of_greenkeeping), the temperature-based turfgrass growth potential, this year's challenging weather, whether one needs to core and topdress putting green turf, where a #TurfFights episode might be staged, and much more.

A few miscellaneous things come to mind. 

1. Joe played one of my favorite songs at the end of the episode, and mentioned a blog post I'd written entitled "Some Rise, some fall, some climb." Here's a [direct link to that post](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2018-06-10-some-rise-some-fall-some-climb/), which was about clipping volume, animated.

2. I mentioned a quote about difficulty convincing someone of something when their salary depends on them not understanding it. I was referring to Upton Sinclair's statement that "It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it!"

3.  We talked about the various ATC newsletters. [Sign-up links for newsletters here](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/lists/).

4. We also discussed MLSN and math. If you want to have a closer look at this, I'd suggest these:

* Jason Haines' post on [MLSN math step-by-step](http://www.turfhacker.com/2018/03/mlsn-math-step-by-step.html)
* Joe's post on MLSN math, which he called [The keyboard is mightier than the fist: how MLSN will save middle class golf](http://www.thewalkinggreenkeeper.com/2018/01/near-end-of-summer-last-season-john.html)
* Brad Revill's blogs about MLSN. There are [four posts here](https://www.bradrevillturf.com/goingagainstthegrain?category=MLSN), all with a little bit of calculation, perhaps most extensively demonstrated in [MLSN updated and calculations](https://www.bradrevillturf.com/goingagainstthegrain/9/1/2017/mlsn-update-and-calculations).
* I mentioned the MLSN cheat sheets---those are [available for download here](https://www.asianturfgrass.com/2018-02-03-new-mlsn-cheat-sheet/).
