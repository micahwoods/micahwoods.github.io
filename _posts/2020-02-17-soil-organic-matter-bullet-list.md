These are some key things I've learned after studying organic matter (OM) for a few years. This is about organic matter in the context of playing conditions---how a ball reacts when it hits the surface. And this is also about the maintenance done to manage organic matter, like sand topdressing, core aerification, and scarification. 

* Standard tests for soil organic matter *exclude* undecayed plant material like thatch, stems, and roots. That misses a lot of the things people are trying to topdress or scarify or manage with coring.

* Standard soil tests for turfgrass sites are to a 10 cm depth, but organic matter accumulation (and ball reaction) are at the surface.

* A special test is required, to measure total organic matter at specific depths.

* Measuring total organic matter in soil samples taken to a 2 cm (0.8 inches) depth provides a useful assessment of prior topdressing effect and of future topdressing requirement.

* I find it most effective to test 100% of the sample that is sent to the lab, with no screening, no removal of aboveground plant material, and with a burn at 440 Â°C.

* Measurements I've made of total organic matter from putting greens, in the top 2 cm, give an average of 7.3%. That's 73 g of organic matter per 1 kg of soil.

* For golf courses, I recommend testing at least three putting greens annually, and taking at least five subsamples per green to form a composite sample.

* By looking at change in total OM in the top 2 cm of the rootzone year after year, one can adjust the topdressing amount to achieve the desired results.

* By looking at change in the total OM at the 2 to 4 cm depth, and at the 4 to 6 cm depth, one can assess the need to add sand (or to remove material) at those depths.

I'm sure that by looking at total OM over time, you'll find this to be incredibly useful.
