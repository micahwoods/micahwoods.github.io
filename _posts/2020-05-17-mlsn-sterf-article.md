There is a new article about MLSN by Trygve Aamlid and Karin Juul Hessels√∏e, available in three languages (including English) on the [STERF website](http://www.sterf.org/sv/about-sterf/news-archive/mlsn-artikel).

I think this article is excellent. It gets at what is different about MLSN, points out a few strengths and weaknesses, and discusses SLAN and precision fertilization (also called demand-driven fertilizer) too.
