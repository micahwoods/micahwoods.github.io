I've written more than 100 blog posts this year. A few of them were read by many -- hundreds, and for a few posts, more than 1,000 -- people. The median post from 2017 got 184 pageviews. The middle 50% of the posts had pageviews from 112 on the low end to 299 on the high end.

And then there are *these ones* that almost no one read. These are the 10 posts of 2017 that got the fewest views -- all have had less than 62 views as of now. For the 2016 list, [see here](http://www.blog.asianturfgrass.com/2016/12/10-posts-that-no-one-read.html).
