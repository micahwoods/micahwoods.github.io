ATC was founded by Dr. Micah Woods in 2006 and since then has provided advisory services and conducted turfgrass research around the world.

We conduct turfgrass research and then share that information through seminars, advisory services, and in writing through [books](http://www.asianturfgrass.com/books/), on [the ATC blog](http://www.asianturfgrass.com/), and in various other [publications](http://ticpass.lib.msu.edu/cgi-bin/flinkbora.pl?name=Woods,%20Micah). We also work with our clients in multiple countries to provide soil (and other laboratory testing) through Brookside Laboratories. 

You can contact us through the links at the bottom of this page. You can also sign up for the [ATC newsletter](http://www.subscribepage.com/atcupdate) or the [MLSN newsletter](http://www.subscribepage.com/mlsn). Both are sent out about 6 times a year.
