ATC was founded by Dr. Micah Woods in 2006 and since then has provided advisory services and conducted turfgrass research around the world.

We share that information through seminars, advisory services, and in writing. We also work with clients in multiple countries to provide soil (and other laboratory testing) through [Brookside Laboratories](https://www.blinc.com/). 

You can contact us through the links at the bottom of this page.
